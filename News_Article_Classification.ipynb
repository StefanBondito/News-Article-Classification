Premium costs have been marching steadily higher since 2022, even as inflation at the consumer level steadily cooled from its 9.1% peak in the middle of that year. Consumers have had some relief as the rate of cost increases for food and energy, two key components of most budgets, has eased greatly.\\n\\nBut auto insurance and car ownership costs have become a sticking point for consumers and the Federal Reserve in its battle to rein inflation back to its goal of 2%.\\n\\nTypically, individuals would see a noticeable increase in their premiums because of speeding tickets and other moving violations. Adding new drivers or a general increase in claims in the area were other reasons.\\n\\nBut the persistent rise in rates over the last two years has been far more sweeping. New vehicle prices starting spiking during the pandemic, mainly because of a worldwide shortage of computer chips amid production cuts and supply chain bottlenecks. Dealers spent much of 2021 with few or no cars in stock.\\n\\nCar price increases eased heading into 2024, with the average at $47,338 in January, down from a peak of $48,516 in late 2022, according to Edmunds.com.\\n\\nHigher value for cars, along with more advanced technology and intricate parts, has raised the overall cost of repairs. Overall maintenance and repair costs jumped 8.2% in March from a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\\u2019s eased a bit over the last year. The rate of increase was as high as 14.2% in early 2023.\\n\\n\\u201cThe severity is really the thing that has influenced rates more over the last two years than anything,\\u201d said Greg Smolan, vice president of insurance operations at AAA Northeast. \\u201cA fender bender in the past didn\\u2019t have all the sensors and cameras.\\u201d\\n\\nHigher overall auto prices and auto repair costs prompted insurers to start raising premiums as overall car values jumped. Price increases for insurance rates, like many other increases from food to clothing, have been sticky and are less likely to drop at the same rate as broader inflation, if at all.\\n\\nThat has been beneficial for insurers who have seen profits surge. Wall Street is expecting bigger leaps in 2024.\\n\\n\\u201cOur sole concentration last year was to get the right rate,\\u201d said Progressive CEO Tricia Griffith, during a fourth-quarter earnings conference call. \\u201cWe feel like we\\u2019re in a really great position now.\\u201d\\n\\nProgressive\\u2019s profit jumped 50% and its revenue surged nearly 18% to $62.1 billion in 2023. Wall Street expects its profit to skyrocket nearly 80% in 2024 on a 14% jump in revenue.\\n\\nAllstate reported a modest profit in 2023 after reporting a loss a year earlier. Wall Street expects its profit to surge 13-fold as revenue rises 10% to $62.9 billion in 2024.\\n\\n\\u201cCompanies are getting a lot closer to rate adequacy now,\\u201d Smolan said. \\u201cI think you\\u2019ll see some flattening out of the real large increases.\\u201d\\n\\nThe process of obtaining auto insurance can be confusing and overwhelming, considering the differing mix of requirements in each state, extra options and the confusing industry and legal jargon used by insurers. The first step for many should be gaining a better understanding about auto insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\\n\\nConsumers should shop around by getting at least three different quotes and from different types of insurance companies. Also, comparing costs before buying a car could help give consumers a better sense of the true cost of owning a specific car. Premiums are based in part on a car\\u2019s price, along with prospective repair costs and safety data.\\n\\nDeductibles could be a major factor in determining monthly premium costs. That\\u2019s the amount of money that a driver is responsible for paying toward a claim. Higher deductibles usually mean lower premiums.\\n\\nBundling multiple policies under one insurer could come with a discount. This is common for homeowners using the same company for their home and auto policies. There may also be discounts for insuring more than one vehicle under the same company.\\n\\nDefensive driving courses also help give drivers discounts on insurance. The timing and standards vary by state, but courses are usually offered in-person and online. Companies including Progressive and Geico often offer multi-year discounts for taking such a course. They can usually steer policy holders toward reputable companies offering the course and certificate.\",\n          \"BANGKOK (AP) \\u2014 Thailand\\u2019s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday revealed details of his government\\u2019s plan to stimulate the economy by giving digital cash handouts of 10,000 baht ($275) to an estimated 50 million Thais for spending at their local businesses.\\n\\nSrettha said at a news conference that the 500-billion-baht ($13.7-billion) plan, to be mostly funded out of the 2024 and 2025 fiscal budgets, will be rolled out in the last quarter of the year.\\n\\nThe stimulus and subsequent consumption are expected to boost gross domestic product growth by 1.2 to 1.6 percentage points, he said. The World Bank estimated Thailand\\u2019s year-on-year GDP growth at 1.5% in December.\\n\\nAnother portion of the funding will come from the state\\u2019s Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, earmarked for covering payouts to about 17 million farmers.\\n\\nThe digital purchases will be allowed only in the recipients\\u2019 own districts, and will not be allowed for items including oil, services, and online purchases.\\n\\nSrettha called the project a \\u201clife-changing policy for the people.\\u201d He expressed his disappointment that the project could not be carried out earlier but said the government needed to make it transparent and legal.\\n\\nThe plan, which was a major campaign promise by Srettha\\u2019s Pheu Thai party ahead of last year\\u2019s general election, had been previously criticized by economists for being an ineffective way to contribute to sustainable economic growth compared to other measures.\\n\\nThe ruling Pheu Thai party had also suggested digital wallet payments for all Thais 16 and older, while the current plan is limited to lower-income Thais, defined as people with yearly incomes not exceeding 840,000 baht ($23,000) and savings in financial institutions not totaling more than 500,000 baht ($13,700 ) .\\n\\nThe government was also criticized for initially suggesting that it would fund the plan by borrowing, which would incur a heavy public debt burden.\\n\\nThailand\\u2019s central bank has resisted pressure from the government to boost the economy by cutting interest rates, opting to keep its policy unchanged at a meeting on Wednesday.\\n\\nBut analysts expect the Bank of Thailand to cut its 2.5% benchmark rate later in the year, given that inflation has been falling for six straight months.\\n\\n\\u201cWhile the economy is not exactly in a crisis, it is in need of more support,\\u201d Gareth Leather of Capital Economics said in a commentary. He noted that the central bank is keen to maintain its independence, but that it ultimately would likely cut rates at its next meeting, in June.\\n\\nThailand\\u2019s levels of household debt are relatively high, and higher interest rates raise borrowing costs, tending to discourage spending and investment.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 For many people, tax season isn\\u2019t only about gathering W-2 forms or calling an accountant. It can also bring intense feelings of stress or anxiety about dealing with finances.\\n\\nFinancial stress during tax season can manifest in different ways, whether that\\u2019s procrastinating on your tax return until the last minute or experiencing intense stress about filing incorrectly. If you\\u2019re dealing with financial stress right now, you\\u2019re not alone.\\n\\n\\u201cMany Americans experience high stress during tax times, and many Americans are dealing with financial stress,\\u201d financial wellness expert Joyce Marter said.\\n\\nYou might think emotions and money don\\u2019t go together, but they often affect each other, said Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, financial therapist and founder of Mind Money Balance.\\n\\n\\u201cOur money and mental health intersect because they\\u2019re two parts of our overall wellness,\\u201d said Bryan-Podvin.\\n\\nHere are recommendations from experts to reduce financial stress during tax season while still getting your return done by the deadline:\\n\\nDon\\u2019t avoid, plan\\n\\nFinancial stress can happen all year long. While tax season is only a window of time, it comes with something that can be daunting: a deadline. Some might find a deadline motivates them to get things done, while others can feel paralyzed by it, said Dr. Tanya Farber, psychologist at McLean Hospital, a mental health facility in Massachusetts.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we\\u2019re overwhelmed by our anxiety, that\\u2019s where it may lead us to avoid thinking about finances or trying to avoid thinking about taxes,\\u201d Farber said.\\n\\nAlthough you do have an option of filing for an extension, Farber doesn\\u2019t recommend prolonging the period when you have to worry about taxes. Instead, a good first step is to make a detailed plan to tackle them.\\n\\nFarber recommends you break down all of the steps and start completing them one by one. A key step is to start gathering all of your documents, such as your W-2 or 1099 forms, savings and investment records, eligible deductions and tax credits, ahead of sitting down to file your taxes. Once you have a list of steps, scheduling times to complete the tasks will make it easier to build momentum.\\n\\nWhile the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:\\n\\nIf you need help making a plan, search for tax checklists, which can be a great tool to make sure you have everything you need.\\n\\nFace your fears\\n\\nFor many, anxiety over filing taxes comes from fear, Farber said. Whether it\\u2019s fear of making a mistake in your return or unexpectedly owing thousands of dollars, these fears can overwhelm you to the point of avoiding even looking at your taxes.\\n\\nIf you identify that fear is what\\u2019s stopping you from filing, Farber recommends that you ask yourself if whatever you\\u2019re afraid of is likely to happen.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we have fears, they\\u2019re possible, probable or definite,\\u201d Farber said. \\u201cAnd oftentimes anxiety is the highest when we\\u2019re assuming the worst-case scenario.\\u201d\\n\\nIf thinking about your fears by yourself is not helping, Bryan-Podvin recommends you discuss them with a friend or a family member. In many cases, talking with someone else might help you focus on what might actually happen rather than focusing on the worst-case scenarios.\\n\\nFocus on self care\\n\\nIf tax season brings a lot of financial stress for you, Bryan-Podvin recommends that you increase the amount of self-care activities you\\u2019re doing. Activities such as taking a walk, spending time with your dog or getting enough sleep can help soothe stress.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are going to be doing things that are difficult and depleting and anxiety-provoking so doing more things that are restorative can help us balance that,\\u201d Farber said.\\n\\nDoing restorative activities can work as a toolbox of coping skills when you\\u2019re in the middle of a stressful situation, like filing taxes.\\n\\nAsk for support\\n\\nYou might feel like you\\u2019ll be judged if you talk about money, but that\\u2019s often not the case. Talking about finances with your friends or family can be a moment to receive support, she said.\\n\\n\\u201cTalking with others is going to give you access to more information and resources and also helps remove the shame and stigma because you\\u2019re not alone,\\u201d Marter said.\\n\\nWhether it\\u2019s talking with a tax professional or reaching out to your most tax-savvy family member, proactively seeking support will help you avoid being stressed if you\\u2019re filing very close to the deadline.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help.\\n\\nIn the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free.\\n\\nOther mental health resources include:\\n\\nVeterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255)\\n\\nCrisis Text Line: Text the word \\u2018Home\\u2019 to 741-741\\n\\nThe Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386\\n\\nThe Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

But there\\u2019s rarely been a better description of the presumptive GOP nominee\\u2019s entire approach to business and politics \\u2013 or the way he\\u2019s promised to behave if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe New York lawyer coined his phrase during a tense hearing on whether Trump violated the terms of the gag order in social media blasts, reposts and comments claiming the jury was full of biased liberals and targeting two potential key witnesses, his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels.\\n\\nAnd in remarks in an interview recorded before Tuesday\\u2019s hearing but that was broadcast as Judge Juan Merchan considers whether to punish Trump, the ex-president was at it again. \\u201cMichael Cohen is a convicted liar and he\\u2019s got no credibility whatsoever,\\u201d Trump said in an interview with WPVI Philadelphia.\\n\\nOnly six days into the trial, Trump is doing what he always does, pushing the rules and conventions of the law and accepted behavior to service his own narrative of victimization he\\u2019s placed at the core of his 2024 campaign.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback Viewer asks why judge can't increase Trump gag order fines. Legal expert weighs in 01:44 - Source: CNN\\n\\nTrump could face a ladder of escalating sanctions\\n\\nProsecutors now want Merchan to fine Trump $1,000 for each of 10 alleged violations of the gag order and to warn that imprisonment could be an option if he continues to flout restrictions. CNN\\u2019s John Miller reported Tuesday that the Secret Service, court officers and the New York City Department of Corrections have quietly consulted on what to do if Trump ends up being jailed for contempt of court. That remedy remains a distant one for now, but any eventual step in that direction cannot be ruled out since no judge can allow a defendant to mock his authority in what is in essence a show of contempt for the rule of law.\\n\\n\\u201cJudge Merchan has to have control of his courtroom,\\u201d former judge and current Cooley Law School professor Jeffrey Swartz told Jim Sciutto on CNN Max. \\u201cHe cannot allow someone who is under a gag order to basically say, \\u2018I don\\u2019t care what you think, judge, I am going to do what I want to do.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s almost inconceivable that any other criminal defendant would get away with lacerating the judge and his court in the way that Trump has done on his Truth Social network, in interviews and in his remarks to cameras outside the court. Trump claims the gag order stifles his right to free speech and to campaign as a presumptive party nominee. But that is blatantly false: the order is narrow \\u2014 even if it was extended by the judge to cover his family following social media attacks by the former president on Merchan\\u2019s daughter.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Merchan grew visibly frustrated with Trump\\u2019s lawyers when they insisted that their client was trying hard to comply with the order, without offering any evidence. At one point, in what quickly turned into a disastrous hearing for Trump\\u2019s team, Merchan warned Trump\\u2019s attorneys they were \\u201closing all credibility with the court.\\u201d Legal sketch artist Elizabeth Williams described the extraordinary moment when the judge clashed with Trump\\u2019s counsel Todd Blanche. \\u201cMerchan is a pretty cool character, he doesn\\u2019t get easily riled up,\\u201d she told CNN\\u2019s Erin Burnett. \\u201cThey were going at it.\\u201d\\n\\nTrying, and failing, to hold Trump to account\\n\\nMerchan, like most judges, may not be used to such affronts. But he\\u2019s the latest in a long line of judges, public officials, political aides and business associates \\u2014 not to mention US laws and the Constitution \\u2014 to try to constrain the former president. And while a dispute over one partial gag order might seem like a small wrinkle in an individual case, it conveys a wider truth about Trump\\u2019s impact on American life.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a common theme in all Trump\\u2019s four criminal cases, other legal quagmires and the single presidential term that produced two impeachments: He constantly refuses to comply with laws that apply to every other American.\\n\\nThe implicit underpinning of all Trump\\u2019s pending trials \\u2013 including two over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one over his hoarding of classified documents and other civil and fraud cases \\u2013 is the same. It\\u2019s that every American is equal in the eyes of the law \\u2013 a principle that even applies to ex-presidents.\\n\\nBut Trump constantly infringes this bedrock value that is the pillar of the legal system. And he will do so in the most audacious of ways on the biggest stage later this week when the US Supreme Court hears his sweeping claim that ex-presidents are immune from prosecution for acts they committed in office. The argument is an attempt to derail special counsel Jack Smith\\u2019s stalled federal election interference case against Trump. The former president posted on Truth Social on Sunday: \\u201cWithout Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Trump is reaching for protections that would absolve the executive office of the presidency of legal accountability for criminal acts \\u2014 a privilege that no other commander in chief in nearly two-and-a-half centuries has enjoyed and which appears to contradict the founding principles of a nation that rebelled against a monarch who was above the law. Most legal scholars believe there\\u2019s no merit to his claims \\u2014 a stance validated by a court of appeals ruling against Trump in Washington, DC. But any decision by the Supreme Court to suggest even some limited areas of presidential immunity could end up changing the scope of the office itself.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback George Conway on what struck him about Trump's gag order hearing 06:49 - Source: CNN\\n\\nTrump seems to consider he\\u2019s above the law\\n\\nThis sense that Trump feels he\\u2019s not covered by the same rules as everyone else shines through all of his legal cases \\u2013 in which he\\u2019s pleaded not guilty \\u2013 as well as his other escapades.\\n\\n\\u2022 He\\u2019s the first president in history to lose an election but insist that he won based on false and debunked claims of mass fraud.\\n\\n\\u2022 He saw nothing wrong, as president, with phoning officials in Georgia and asking them to \\u201cfind\\u201d votes that did not exist so he could try to overturn President Joe Biden\\u2019s win in the critical swing state in 2020. The ex-president insisted the call was \\u201cperfect\\u201d \\u2014 the same phrase he used to describe his attempt to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the Biden family in a conversation that led to his first impeachment.\\n\\n\\u2022 The impulse to ignore gag orders and most accepted understandings of the limits of presidential power seems to spring from the same contempt for the rule of law that led Trump to allegedly mishandle troves of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and to claim they belonged to him and not the country. He\\u2019s also awaiting trial in this case in which he\\u2019s pleaded not guilty.\\n\\n\\u2022 A sense that the law only applies to other people may have also informed the ex-president\\u2019s overvaluing of his properties to secure preferential treatment from banks and insurance firms \\u2014 an assumption countermanded by his loss in a near half-a-billion dollar civil fraud trial judgement against him, the Trump Organization and his adult sons earlier this year.\\n\\nWhile Trump\\u2019s obliviousness to constraints horrifies his opponents, his willingness to tear down legal and political institutions is the key to his appeal to millions of supporters.\\n\\nIn his bid to win back the White House, Trump is appealing to Americans who distrust governing elites in politics, the law, the medical establishment and the media. He\\u2019s posing as a champion who is enduring persecution so that they won\\u2019t have to. \\u201cI am your justice \\u2026 and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\\u201d Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2023, reviving his bond with his populist base voters.\\n\\nBut Trump\\u2019s willingness to trample the law and the principles of a democratic, constitutional system has severed his links with more traditional conservatives. George Conway, a conservative lawyer who before 2020 always voted for Republicans for president, will headline a fundraiser for Biden on Wednesday and will give nearly a million dollars to a joint fundraising committee to try to reelect him because he\\u2019s worried about Trump\\u2019s pledge to devote his possible second term to retribution. He warned Trump \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t care a whit about the Constitution, about the rule of law. He wants to undermine the country and its rule of law for his own political purposes.\\u201d\\n\\nConway, who was in court for the Trump trial on Tuesday, became emotional as he explained his decision to donate the maximum amount possible in an interview with CNN\\u2019s Burnett.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s going to come out of my kids\\u2019 inheritance, but the most important thing they can inherit is living in a constitutional democracy,\\u201d Conway said.\",\n          \"CNN \\u2014\\n\\nDonald Trump\\u2019s three-day deadline to find nearly half a billion dollars or risk seeing his cherished property empire dismantled building by building is creating one of the most extraordinary twists ever seen in a US presidential election campaign.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s new drama concerns his struggle to come up with a bond to cover $464 million plus interest charges so that he can appeal a civil fraud trial judgment against him, his adult sons and his company. If he can\\u2019t somehow find the money by Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James may begin seizing some of Trump\\u2019s assets to finance his obligation to the state. She has laid the groundwork with court filings that suggest Trump\\u2019s Seven Springs estate and golf course in Westchester County, New York, could be among her first targets.\\n\\n\\u201cThe attorney general is ready to go. They are ready to go after his money to try to fulfill the judgment,\\u201d Adam Leitman Bailey, a real estate attorney who sued Trump seven times, told CNN\\u2019s Erin Burnett. \\u201cThe question is how hard it is going to be to collect.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile this is primarily a crisis about Trump\\u2019s business and personal wealth, it is creating real political implications given his status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. No other candidate has ever faced such a distraction in the middle of an election campaign \\u2013 and that\\u2019s separate from the former commander-in-chief\\u2019s parallel constellation of criminal cases that will dominate the run-up to Election Day and potentially add to the tumult of his second presidency if he beats President Joe Biden. And yet, Trump\\u2019s continued resilience as a candidate remains on display, as featured in two new CNN polls conducted by SSRS that were released on Friday, one of which shows the former president leading 50%-42% in Michigan and in a dead heat with Biden in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s increasingly alarmed posts on social media on Thursday offered a window into his desperation. And they showed how every one of his cases now has a similar defense. He claims he\\u2019s not guilty of breaking the law but is the victim of endless political persecution. \\u201cELECTION INTERFERENCE,\\u201d Trump for instance wrote on his Truth Social network. He complained that putting up money to permit an appeal was \\u201cVERY EXPENSIVE.\\u201d And he sent out a fundraising appeal to supporters titled \\u201cKeep your filthy hands off of Trump Tower!\\u201d\\n\\nOn Friday morning, the former president wrote on Truth Social that he has \\u201cALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\\u201d Chris Kise, an attorney for Trump, later clarified that Trump was referring to \\u201cmoney reported on his campaign disclosure forms that he\\u2019s built up through years of owning and managing successful businesses,\\u201d not cash on hand.\\n\\nEven one of his legal cases would have been enough to drive any conventional candidate from the race long ago. But Trump leads many national and swing state polls, a sign that his attempts to spin his flurry of legal duress as persecution are working among many Republican voters. His standing in the race also reflects the daunting problems shadowing Biden\\u2019s reelection bid as the unpopular president tries to convince Americans that a recovering economy is healthier than they perceive in their daily lives given expensive trips to grocery stores and the high interest rates that make housing and other major purchases so daunting.\\n\\nWhile Trump\\u2019s enemies would relish his property portfolio being gutted by James, the political impact of such a humiliation would be uncertain. The resulting furor might add fuel to the ex-president\\u2019s claims he is being unfairly targeted by Democratic prosecutors because of who he is. One of his closest allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is already trying to foster such an impression by slamming what she claimed was a \\u201cfundamentally un-American\\u201dcampaign against him. At the same time, however, the latest controversy surrounding Trump may begin to remind moderate Republican and independent voters of the daily chaos that characterized his years in office. The Biden campaign has long maintained this will inevitably shift voters the president\\u2019s way, even if there is little evidence in the polls so far of that happening.\\n\\nA long list of legal challenges\\n\\nThe ex-president\\u2019s struggle to come up with funds, after multiple insurance firms declined to underwrite the bond, is a humiliating spectacle for a former president whose image as a masterful property magnate is central to his public brand. The frenzied search for money raises painful questions about the extent of Trump\\u2019s liquid wealth about which he has long boasted. It\\u2019s also an undignified plight for someone who could be occupying the White House in 10 months, and suggests troubling conflicts of interest if he turns to private donors \\u2014 or overseas sources \\u2014 to find the money in an 11th-hour dash for cash.\\n\\nThe implications of the rush to finance the bond have caused panic in the ex-president\\u2019s inner circle, CNN\\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reported this week. But as grave as it is, the drama around the bond payment is only one of the multiple perils confronting Trump.\\n\\n\\u2014 On Thursday, CNN reported that Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, plans to push hard for a trial before November\\u2019s election in a bid to thwart Trump\\u2019s delaying tactics \\u2013 despite narrowly escaping being thrown off her election interference case following an intimate relationship with a fellow prosecutor. Given the complexity of the racketeering case, which includes an array of former Trump associates as co-defendants, any such timeline feels wildly optimistic. \\u201cI really think this is mostly just posturing by the DA\\u2019s office,\\u201d Michael Moore, a former US attorney, told CNN on Thursday. And while Willis wants a trial date soon, she is still not completely secure. The judge who allowed her to continue on the case despite rebuking her conduct, has granted the defendants the right to appeal his decision.\\n\\n\\u2014 Elsewhere in Trump\\u2019s multi-city legal quagmire, Judge Arthur Engoron, who oversaw the New York civil fraud case that Trump lost, imposed new constraints on the the Trump Organization by expanding the reach of the monitor who is providing court-ordered oversight. The move means the firm will not for instance be able to move large amounts of money or take any significant business steps without scrutiny \\u2014 a departure for a company that has always played by its own set of rules.\\n\\n\\u2014 Also in New York, the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office called on a judge to impose no further delay in the trial over Trump\\u2019s payment of hush money to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign. The trial had been set to start on Monday but was postponed after new documents surfaced and the former president is now asking for a 90-day delay. Judge Juan Merchan has postponed the case at least until April 15 and is due to hold a hearing on discovery issues on Monday that could also produce a firm trial date.\\n\\n\\u2014 All of this is unfolding as other Trump trials \\u2014 including federal prosecutions on election interference and the alleged mishandling of classified documents \\u2013 are on hold as he tries to run out the clock ahead of November\\u2019s election with frenzied litigation and the filing of appeals. The Supreme Court is due to hear his sweeping claim of presidential immunity for acts committed in office next month and a ruling is not expected until late June. The decision could have important implications for the criminal cases that Trump is facing as he seeks a second term.\\n\\n\\u2014 Yet, in one ray of light for the ex-president this week, his net worth could soon be set to soar with the merger of his media properties including the Truth Social network and Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check firm. The move would make Trump by far the largest shareholder of the merged, publicly traded company and would on paper add billions of dollars to his net worth. In theory, this is the kind of windfall that could help Trump at a moment of extreme financial distress and at a moment when his campaign fundraising is falling well short of Biden\\u2019s. In practice, however, conditions of a deal mean that the ex-president could not liquidate his shares to ease his cash crunch immediately. And if he were to sell, the price of the company\\u2019s stock would likely tumble.\\n\\nHow James plans to extract the state\\u2019s due from Trump\\n\\nState lawyers filed judgments in Westchester County, north of Manhattan, on March 6 \\u2013 a week after Engoron\\u2019s civil fraud judgment finding that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization had committed massive fraud, largely through overvaluations of property to secure favorable loans from banks and better rates from insurance companies.\\n\\nThe former president\\u2019s lawyers disclosed this week that he had failed to find an insurance company to underwrite a bond that would guarantee the state\\u2019s financial stake in the case while the appeal process plays out. Trump has already filed a nearly $100 million bond in another case, after losing a defamation claim to the writer E. Jean Carroll, which he also plans to appeal.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s attorneys have warned that any attempt to sell off properties to meet the judgment would cause him permanent financial damage since buyers would demand \\u201cfire sale\\u201d prices.\\u201d\\n\\nThere\\u2019s also another reason why an attempt by James to seize his assets could be problematic for the ex-president \\u2014 and is a far more complicated proposition for the attorney general than it might first appear.\\n\\nSome of Trump\\u2019s buildings and properties are sure to be financed by mortgages and other financial arrangements that will be difficult to unravel. In the event of a sale, the proceeds would go first to make good the lenders, meaning that a substantial chunk of the Trump empire may need to be sold off to reach the near half billion dollar figure owed to the state.\\n\\nOne option that Trump might be forced to consider is bankruptcy \\u2014 a route he has used several times in his flamboyant and checkered business career and that may allow him to dispose of assets in an organized way. But Collins reported this week that he has privately expressed opposition to that path, and it remains the least likely way out for now.\\n\\nUltimately, the stigma of enduring such a process so close to a general election might be too much for the ex-president to bear. And it would add to concerns that the former president isn\\u2019t fit for a return to the Oval Office.\\n\\nWhatever the resolution, the multiple dramas again strike at the question at the heart of this election: Do Americans really want four more years of the mayhem, scandal and challenges to the law that rage around the former president week after week?\",\n          \"Former US President Donald Trump sits in the courtroom at Manhattan criminal court in New York, US, on Thursday, April 18, 2024.\\n\\nDonald Trump on Saturday took to social media to deliver another tirade against the judge and the circumstances of his New York hush money trial, which wrapped up jury selection on Friday and is expected to begin opening arguments on Monday.\\n\\n\\\"THIS SCAM 'RUSHED' TRIAL TAKING PLACE IN A 95% DEMOCRAT AREA IS A PLANNED AND COORDINATED WITCH HUNT,\\\" the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee wrote in one of several Truth Social posts on Saturday morning. \\\"IT IS BEING PRESIDED OVER BY POSSIBLY THE MOST CONFLICTED JUDGE IN JUDICIAL HISTORY, WHO MUST BE REMOVED FROM THIS HOAX IMMEDIATELY.\\\"\\n\\nThe rant comes a day after Trump's attorneys requested to delay the trial to find a new location, claiming that New York City residents were too biased to find a fair jury.\\n\\nA Manhattan appeals court quickly rejected Trump's request, the latest of roughly a dozen attempts to delay the trial, which was initially scheduled to kick off March 25.\\n\\nDespite Trump's efforts to postpone, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, who presides over Trump's case, said that opening arguments for the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president would start Monday morning.\\n\\nTrump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to an alleged cover-up of a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\\n\\nTrump's social media rants targeting Merchan and others involved in the trial have become a regular pattern for the former president, despite a gag order imposed in March.\\n\\nTrump has publicly gone after the judge's daughter, who has worked for a progressive political consulting firm, and has repeatedly called for the judge to recuse himself.\\n\\nProsecutors on Monday asked Merchan to penalize Trump for his apparent gag order violations, specifically citing three of his social media posts, which targeted several witnesses, including Stormy Daniels and his former lawyer Michael Cohen.\\n\\nThe prosecutors requested a $1,000 sanction for each of the three posts and asked the judge to warn Trump that future violations could result in jail time.\\n\\nMerchan said he would schedule a hearing on the prosecutors' request for Wednesday.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Media\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cnbc.com\",\n          \"https://apnews.com\",\n          \"https://edition.cnn.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Die Schwarzroten have finished second in the league multiple times. The club has seen cult figures grace its doors before leaving for pastures new after the catalogue of gut-wrenching defeats.\\n\\nFor Leverkusen\\u2019s long-suffering fans, they were there just to be ridiculed by rival fans.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re going to the stadium and in the Bundesliga, all the other team\\u2019s fans say, \\u2018You\\u2019ll never win the Bundesliga,\\u2019 and this is hurting a little bit,\\u201d Olaf Schmidt \\u2013 Leverkusen fan and volunteer at the club\\u2019s BayArena \\u2013 told CNN Sport after traveling to London to watch his team play its Europa League quarterfinal second-leg tie against West Ham United.\\n\\nBut Alonso has restored Leverkusen\\u2019s pride.\\n\\nThe former Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Spain international midfifelder has instilled a never-say-die attitude into his players; his squad has become renowned for its propensity to pull late goals out when the odds seem stacked against them \\u2013 including on Thursday night when Jeremie Frimpong scored in the 89th minute to keep the longest unbeaten run in the history of Europe\\u2019s top four leagues (Germany, England, Spain and Italy) alive.\\n\\nAlonso has brought bravery to a team which has been personified by fragility.\\n\\nSince being hired in 2022, Xabi Alonso has brought about remarkable success for Leverkusen. Lars Baron/Getty Images\\n\\nHis players must be courageous to execute Alonso\\u2019s possession-based style of play and, through his signings and temperament, the Leverkusen coach has asked for bravery from those around him to believe in the system.\\n\\nWhether it be Florian Wirtz\\u2019s wizardry on the ball and incisive passes or the discipline needed from his defenders and goalkeeper to recycle possession in their own penalty area, this Leverkusen team has become a winning machine under the man from Tolosa.\\n\\nNot in their wildest dreams could Die Werkself fans have imagined their team would supplant Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga champion for the past 11 seasons, and in such emphatic fashion.\\n\\nAnd to the pocket of vocal Leverkusen supporters \\u2013 dressed all in red, hopping up and down, celebrating their \\u2018Deutscher Meister\\u2019 campaign while serenading their favorite players \\u2013 at the Olympic Stadium in London to see Bayer advance to the Europa League semifinals after drawing 1-1 with West Ham to win the quarterfinal tie 3-2 on aggregate, this means so much more.\\n\\nLeverkusen sealed its first league title in its 119 year history with five games to go, battering Werder Bremen 5-0 in front of the home fans to kickstart the party of all parties.\\n\\nAlonso was doused in beer, there were tears and fans streamed onto the pitch to celebrate an until now once-in-a-lifetime achievement.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was unbelievable. I\\u2019ve only been a fan for around about 20-25 years, but I know a lot of people who were fans when the club came to the Bundesliga, which was 45 years ago,\\u201d Schmidt told CNN.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd we never could win the Bundesliga and it was so impressive. Everybody was on the pitch this evening, everybody was crying.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter years being the butt of the joke, Leverkusen fans could finally spin the narrative.\\n\\n\\u201cAll our supporters, we sang: \\u2018We will never win the Bundesliga.\\u2019 It showed the verbal (middle) finger to others,\\u201d added Schmidt.\\n\\nLeverkusen fans celebrated en masse on the pitch after winning the German league title. Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\\n\\nGerman football values the structure of its club ownership, as evidenced by the 50+1 rule \\u2013 where supporters will always retain a majority ownership of a team, even by one vote \\u2013 to ensure fans retain a say in the running of the organization. This has historically meant that the Black and Reds aren\\u2019t beloved by their contemporaries due support and backing from pharmaceutical company Bayer.\\n\\nBut Leverkusen\\u2019s seminal season under Alonso has superseded that and captured the imagination of many German football fans given it has come at Bayern Munich\\u2019s expense.\\n\\nAnd the season isn\\u2019t done yet. As well as reaching the semifinals of the Europa League, the 2023-24 campaign could finish with a famous treble as Leverkusen faces second-tier FC Kaiserslautern in the German Cup final in May.\\n\\nAnd as for all that pain and the mocking that came with it?\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s history,\\u201d Uwe Schewiola, a Leverkusen fan since 1992, told CNN.\",\n          \"CLEVELAND (AP) \\u2014 Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers spent the week insisting they were better prepared for this year\\u2019s playoffs.\\n\\nOn Saturday, they looked it.\\n\\nMitchell scored 30 points, Jarrett Allen had 18 rebounds and the Cavs looked tougher \\u2014 mentally and physically \\u2014 than in last year\\u2019s first-round flop, beating the Orlando Magic 97-83 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference playoff series.\\n\\n\\u201cLast year is over with,\\u201d Mitchell said. \\u201cWe flushed that. This is who we are, and this is who we expect to be.\\u201d\\n\\nEvan Mobley added 16 points and Darius Garland had 14 for Cleveland, which got bullied and bounced in just five games by the New York Knicks in the 2023 postseason.\\n\\nThat experience scarred the Cavs, who entered these playoffs more confident, deeper (at least on paper) and relatively healthy after a regular season filled with injuries.\\n\\nMitchell has been slowed for two months with a left knee bone bruise, but the All-Star guard moved well and looked much more like himself as Cleveland\\u2019s only viable offensive threat for more than two quarters.\\n\\nIn the first half, Mitchell scooped up a loose ball and went in for a soaring dunk that served notice that he was back, and that the Cavs would be much better in his second postseason with Cleveland.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is who I am,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s kind of been my message all year. This is why I\\u2019m here. I could have had 10 points as long as we got the job done.\\u201d\\n\\nOrlando\\u2019s Paolo Banchero scored 24 points in his playoff debut, but had nine turnovers. The Magic shot just 33% from the field \\u2014 some of it attributed to bad shooting, some because of Cleveland\\u2019s defense.\\n\\n\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t score enough,\\u201d Banchero said. \\u201cJust shots weren\\u2019t falling, but I thought we got good looks. We missed a lot of free throws (19 of 30) and didn\\u2019t make 3s (8 of 37). There were a lot of things we could have done a lot better.\\u201d\\n\\nGame 2 is Monday at raucous Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, where fans didn\\u2019t have much to cheer last spring as the Knicks ended the Cavaliers\\u2019 run shortly after it began.\\n\\nMitchell slept only two hours Friday night as his nerves \\u2014 and the 1 p.m. tip \\u2014 messed with his pregame routine. But once he got to the arena and heard Phil Collins\\u2019 anthemic \\u201cIn The Air Tonight\\u201d blaring, he quickly got into playoff mode.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s ready for the moment and it\\u2019s the Game 1s,\\u201d Cavs coach J.B. Bickestaff said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the bigger games during the regular season. He has the ability and the understanding of how important the start is, whatever that may be.\\u201d\\n\\nLike the Cavs a year ago, the Magic lack playoff experience and it showed.\\n\\nOrlando\\u2019s offense was unorganized and Banchero too often tried to force things. He went 9 of 17 from the floor in 41 minutes.\\n\\nThe Cavs have waited all season for a chance at redemption following last season\\u2019s first-round flameout.\\n\\nAnd while they were in control for most of the game, they had just seven field goals over an 18-minute stretch and only led 60-56 when Banchero converted a three-point play with 4:24 left in the third.\\n\\nMitchell settled things down with back-to-back buckets and Cleveland closed the third with a 13-2 run that sent the Cavs into the fourth leading by 15.\\n\\nThe Magic twice cut a 20-point deficit to nine in the fourth, but the Cavs responded and Mitchell\\u2019s 3-pointer with 4:44 left ended any thought of an Orlando comeback.\\n\\nTempers flared between the teams in the second quarter, leading to some jawing, finger-pointing and two technical fouls being called.\\n\\nOrlando\\u2019s Moritz Wagner pushed an off-balance Mobley as he was falling out of bounds on the baseline and his clapping annoyed Cleveland\\u2019s Isaac Okoro, who shoved Wagner and drew a technical.\\n\\nMoments later, Magic guard Markelle Fultz was assessed a flagrant-1 for his foul on Georges Niang, who was driving to the basket. Niang didn\\u2019t like it, walked toward Fultz and was slapped with a T for taunting as Cleveland\\u2019s crowd roared.\\n\\nAs if the Cavs needed any reminders, Tom Petty\\u2019s \\u201cI Won\\u2019t Back Down\\u201d played over the arena\\u2019s sound system as Fultz\\u2019s foul was reviewed.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s the playoffs, right?\\u201d said Niang, signed by the Cavs to improve their toughness. \\u201cYou expect everything to just be amplified to a whole new level. So whatever they were planning on doing, I was expecting it to be as physical as it was, if not more physical.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s just the playoffs. It\\u2019s a battle. You may have friends out there, but we\\u2019re not friends.\\u201d\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nAfter Monday\\u2019s matchup, the series shifts to Orlando for Game 3 on Thursday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\",\n          \"THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) \\u2014 Nelly Korda hasn\\u2019t really considered her place in history as she prepares to chase her fifth consecutive victory, which would tie the LPGA record, this weekend at the Chevron Championship.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m so in the present that I don\\u2019t let myself think about that too much,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI feel like that just comes with a little bit more added pressure.\\u201d\\n\\nShe does, however, appreciate the feedback she gets from her youngest fans.\\n\\n\\u201cObviously there is nothing better to me than seeing all the little kids come out and saying that I inspire them to pick up a golf club or I\\u2019m their favorite golfer,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere is no better feeling than that. Hopefully I do get to inspire the next generation with the love that I have for the game and hopefully they have it too.\\u201d\\n\\nThis tournament is the first of five women\\u2019s major championships this season where Korda will try to win her first major since the KPMG Women\\u2019s PGA Championship in 2021 and join Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) as the only women to win five consecutive LPGA events.\\n\\nShe\\u2019ll compete against a field which includes last year\\u2019s Chevron champion Lilia Vu, who captured her first major with the victory. She was the LPGA player of the year last year after going on to win the Women\\u2019s British Open.\\n\\nThe 26-year-old is looking forward to defending her title in a place that she quickly became quite fond of.\\n\\n\\u201cInstantly when I landed in Houston it felt very calming to me,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI felt almost sort of home. I don\\u2019t know, I just kept thinking about it. Even my parents were talking about it last night. Could be a place to consider to move.\\u201d\\n\\nVu won last year\\u2019s tournament in dramatic fashion with a birdie on the first playoff hole to outlast Angel Yin.\\n\\nVu likes the increased attention that women\\u2019s golf is getting recently because of Korda\\u2019s streak and likened it to the surge in popularity of women\\u2019s basketball because of superstar Caitlin Clark.\\n\\n\\u201cShe is bringing so much to the table, just win after win, just having everything together,\\u201d Vu said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s done such a good job. So well liked and loved out here. She brings a big following. She\\u2019s a great person. So \\u2026 she\\u2019s kind of our Caitlin Clark out here.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s the second year the tournament will be held at The Club At Carlton Woods in suburban Houston after more than 50 years at Mission Hills in the California desert.\\n\\nChevron announced this week that it will remain the tournament\\u2019s title sponsor through 2029 and that the purse for this year\\u2019s event will increase to $7.9 million.\\n\\nFollowing last year\\u2019s debut in Texas, the Jack Nicklaus Signature Course underwent renovations that affected all 18 holes. Those renovations included a new irrigation system, sand capped fairways, newly constructed bunkers moved closer to the greens and each green was rebuilt to USGA specifications.\\n\\nStacy Lewis, the 2011 Chevron champion, who grew up in The Woodlands, is impressed with the upgrades.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, I like the changes,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMade some holes a little bit more difficult ... and it\\u2019s in great shape. I think it\\u2019s very impressive how the greens have come out being brand new.\\u201d\\n\\nAlong with Korda and Vu, the tournament will feature Lydia Ko, who could earn a spot in the LPGA Hall of Fame with a win. Ko won the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions in January for her 20th LPGA title.\\n\\nThe tournament will also serve as a farewell to So Yeon Ryu, who is retiring from competitive golf after this event following 13 seasons on the LPGA Tour. She has six titles, highlighted by two majors \\u2014 the 2011 U.S. Women\\u2019s Open and the 2017 title at this tournament.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Media\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://edition.cnn.com\",\n          \"https://apnews.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sports\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But now, 41 years into their journey, the band has conceived yet another new way to experience their music live: four concerts at Sphere, the $2.3 billion venue in Las Vegas that was christened last fall with a series of shows by U2. The Phish shows kicked off Thursday and run through Sunday night.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a paradigm shift in live music and visual (presentation),\\u201d Trey Anastasio, Phish\\u2019s bandleader and creative force, told CNN in an interview last week about the Sphere dates. \\u201cIt\\u2019s \\u2026 an exciting new canvas.\\u201d\\n\\nPhish is just the second band to play Sphere, after U2. The state-of-the-art, spherical venue is dominated by a giant LED screen some 250 feet high that wraps above and around the audience. That vast screen, along with 167,000 speakers that ensure pristine sound, make for an immersive concertgoing experience.\\n\\nBut while U2 played mostly the same set list and paired songs with pre-made videos that repeated each night, Phish is taking their usual freewheeling approach.\\n\\nThe band is not repeating any songs over their four-night run, and each show\\u2019s visuals are different and even improvised in the moment, similar to what fans have become accustomed to from Phish\\u2019s long-time lighting designer, Chris \\u201cCK5\\u201d Kuroda.\\n\\n\\u201cAll of our visuals can be executed, modified, and manipulated in real time,\\u201d the band\\u2019s creative director for the shows at Sphere, Abigail Rosen Holmes, told CNN. \\u201cThey will follow the band\\u2019s musical performance, rather than being locked in, allowing Phish to play as freely as they would at any other show.\\u201d\\n\\nPhish performing Thursday at Sphere. \\u201cI could see the audience so clearly,\\\" bandleader Trey Anastasio said after. Alive Coverage\\n\\nSure enough, on Thursday\\u2019s opening night the psychedelic animations and graphics appeared to soar and glide to the music, creating 3D effects on Sphere\\u2019s huge screen. Each song featured distinct visual eye candy, from layered abstract tapestries to breathtaking scenic imagery \\u2014 both earthly and otherworldly.\\n\\nDaniel Jean of Moment Factory, the Montreal-based multimedia studio that produced and co-directed the visuals, told CNN that working on Sphere\\u2019s immersive\\u2019s screen \\u201chas opened the door to creativity in ways we haven\\u2019t been able to explore before. The emotions of the music, mixed cohesively with the visuals on the screen, create an emphatic moment only truly felt by those in the venue.\\u201d\\n\\nMembers of Phish say they studied U2\\u2019s 40-concert Sphere residency to prepare for playing the venue. Phish\\u2019s audio engineer even re-created a miniature version of Sphere\\u2019s production setup at a practice studio in Pennsylvania last summer so the band could fine-tune the shows\\u2019 look and sound.\\n\\nLast week, Anastasio said it would be a challenge to use Sphere\\u2019s massive space in a way that still felt organic.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen you see a large-scale production \\u2014 you know, Beyonc\\u00e9 or U2 or anything that\\u2019s really a big, major pop act \\u2014 the production and the music are on a click. So it makes it easier to have everything happen at the proper time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd we don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d\\n\\nBut after Thursday night\\u2019s show he sounded pleased with the venue, saying he felt \\u201can intimacy\\u201d at Sphere despite its cavernous size.\\n\\n\\u201cI could see the audience so clearly, which has such a huge effect on the music. When I can look directly at people dancing, I play so much better. I can react to their energy. I did not expect that,\\u201d he told CNN via email. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a huge blessing. It felt very comfortable.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom the start Phish cultivated a profound bond with its audience\\n\\nPhish\\u2019s signature sound centers around progressive rock arrangements infused with a variety of musical genres, including jazz, funk and blues and beyond.\\n\\nThe band formed in 1983 while its members were attending college in Vermont, where Anastasio met drummer Jon Fishman and bassist Mike Gordon. Keyboardist Page McConnell joined the group about two years later.\\n\\n\\u201cWe started out as a group of friends, in a room with our friends,\\u201d Anastasio said. \\u201cWe would play until 1:30 in the morning, and then we would all go out to Howard Johnson\\u2019s for eggs and French toast. Literally, like the band and the audience. And in some respects, that never changed. It still feels like that.\\u201d\\n\\nIn their infancy the band started playing residencies at Nectars, then a Burlington restaurant and bar with a small stage in the corner. From the beginning they practiced their complex arrangements religiously, often following Anastasio\\u2019s daily schedule detailing which times they would flesh out specific sections of each tune.\\n\\nGradually Phish built a fan base, mostly through relentless touring across the US.\\n\\nPage McConnell, Trey Anastasio and Jon Fishman of Phish, left to right, perform at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, on October 6, 2023. Keith Griner/Getty Images for ABA\\n\\n\\u201cWe built up this following just by playing,\\u201d Gordon says in \\u201cBittersweet Motel,\\u201d director Todd Phillips\\u2019 2000 documentary about the band. \\u201cIt was never really records or radio or videos or anything like that that boosted our career. It was all this word-of-mouth thing.\\u201d\\n\\nThe fans come to shows \\u201cbecause they don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to happen,\\u201d Gordon added, \\u201cjust like we don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to happen\\u201d \\u2014 a sentiment that both band members and fans say hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were never really in the public eye,\\u201d Anastasio told CNN last week. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have hits, or go the Grammys, or anything like that. It\\u2019s a community, is what it is. And it really, truly is. And it still feels that way. I think that\\u2019s pretty much a big part of what makes us different.\\u201d\\n\\nAnastasio says he can feel the \\u201cenergy\\u201d from the crowd during each show, and that informs his decisions on what the band plays in real time \\u2014 an approach Phish has taken its entire existence.\\n\\n\\u201cIt has a mind of its own. Everything\\u2019s fair game,\\u201d Anastasio said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a combination of discipline and complete abandon. I don\\u2019t think you can have one without the other.\\u201d\\n\\nThe band\\u2019s concerts have included covers of other groups\\u2019 classic albums \\u2014 and donuts\\n\\nAnastasio says he enjoys spearheading the complicated logistics required to pull off their elaborate productions. His focus is making sure his bandmates stay in the moment on stage.\\n\\n\\u201cIf Mike Gordon is totally not thinking, he plays the sickest bass of anybody who has ever lived,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs soon as you get him thinking, he\\u2019s not playing well anymore.\\u201d\\n\\nAnastasio says his most exhilarating live moments are when the band goes \\u201ccompletely off the map\\u201d into uncharted musical territory.\\n\\nPhish took full advantage of the massive Sphere LED screen. \\u201cThey built an incredible bond with fans by super serving their audience,\\u201d says SiriusXM's Ari Fink. Alive Coverage\\n\\n\\u201cAnd there are many of them \\u2026 where I don\\u2019t know where the downbeat is, and I don\\u2019t know what key we\\u2019re in anymore. And my head is exploding about what Mike is playing or what Fish is playing or what Page is playing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd \\u2026 it feels like being in a tiny, tiny rowboat in the middle of a storm in the ocean.\\u201d\\n\\nThe band has played more concerts at New York\\u2019s fabled Madison Square Garden than any act except Billy Joel. On New Year\\u2019s Eve in 2022, Phish turned the arena into a giant undersea visual spectacle, complete with flying dolphins. A year later they created an almost fully realized Broadway show at MSG from their beloved \\u201cGamehendge\\u201d suite, a fantasy rock opera last played in its entirety in 1994.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople will ask us \\u2026 a normal band would build something like that and then take it on tour for four years. Why do you just do these things once?\\u201d Anastasio said. \\u201cAnd my response would be that most of the people in the room have been seeing us for so long, we feel like we owe them a new, fresh experience.\\u201d\\n\\nThe band also has become well known for staging elaborate events. For Halloween, they sometimes adopt \\u201cmusical costumes\\u201d and perform other artists\\u2019 classic albums, a tradition they started in 1994 with a surprise cover of the Beatles\\u2019 White Album in its entirety.\\n\\nOn New Year\\u2019s Eve 1999 they hosted The Big Cypress festival in the Florida Everglades, where they played from midnight to sunrise before tens of thousands of fans to usher in the new millennium.\\n\\nAnd in 2017 they famously played a string of themed shows over 13 nights at Madison Square Garden \\u2014 an event nicknamed the \\u201cBaker\\u2019s Dozen\\u201d \\u2014 which included a different donut served to the audience each night.\\n\\nIn an era of tightly scripted concerts, this playful, unpredictable approach has endeared them to fans.\\n\\nPhish's Trey Anastasio: \\\"We feel like we owe ... (our fans) a new, fresh experience.\\u201d Alive Coverage\\n\\n\\u201cEvery single show is different, and they keep challenging themselves to be better,\\u201d said longtime Phish fan Andy Bernstein, who authored the first edition of The Pharmer\\u2019s Almanac, an encyclopedia that compiles the band\\u2019s history and statistics.\\n\\n\\u201cThey built an incredible bond with fans by super serving their audience,\\u201d said Ari Fink, senior director of music programming at SiriusXM Radio, where he worked with the band to create a Phish radio channel.\\n\\nFink says he understands the band\\u2019s non-traditional music may not be accessible to casual listeners.\\n\\n\\u201cI can totally understand the barrier of entry that some music fans might experience when they give Phish a shot, but the playfulness and the commitment to their craft are the two benchmarks they bring to the table,\\u201d he told CNN.\\n\\nThe band\\u2019s members have been through a lot together\\n\\nAfter their sold-out shows at Sphere, where top seats are commanding more than $2,000 on the secondary market, the quartet plans to go back on the road for another summer tour this July. The same month they also plan to release \\u201cEvolve,\\u201d their 16th studio album.\\n\\nThe four members of Phish have been playing together since the 1980s, when they were college students in Vermont. Alive Coverage\\n\\nIn August Phish are scheduled to host the Mondegreen festival in Delaware, their 11th self-produced large festival, a tradition the band started in 1996 by taking over a decommissioned Air Force Base in upstate New York.\\n\\nNo band endures for four decades without some turbulence, and Phish is no different. Anastasio battled drug and alcohol abuse before getting clean in the mid-2000s. The band took several hiatuses, and its future once was unclear.\\n\\nBut the four musicians have persevered, and they say their brotherhood has deepened over the years. Anastasio says his level of awe for his bandmates has grown consistently since they met as teenagers, and they all feel immense gratitude that they still get to create magic together onstage.\\n\\n\\u201cThe amount of material and the amount of shared history is just incomprehensible at this point in time. I\\u2019m trying to find some wood to knock on, but it doesn\\u2019t seem to be slowing down at all,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cWalking on stage has become consistently more emotional as the years have gone by, like we look at each other before we go on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I have another chance to play with these guys, wherever we are.\\u201d\",\n          \"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Jonathan Tetelman transformed from a nightclub DJ to an international opera star, a music detour that was quite, well, operatic.\\n\\nHe stopped singing in 2011 and mixed music for New York\\u2019s clubbers at Webster Hall, Pacha, Greenhouse and W.i.P. These days, the 35-year-old\\u2019s gigs are at posher places such as London\\u2019s Royal Opera House and the Salzburg Festival.\\n\\nHis career revived by a transition to tenor from baritone, Tetelman will be featured as Ruggero in a Metropolitan Opera performance of Puccini\\u2019s \\u201cLa Rondine (The Swallow)\\u201d with soprano Angel Blue, televised live to theaters worldwide Saturday. Starting April 26, he sings Pinkerton in \\u201cMadama Butterfly\\u201d opposite soprano Asmik Grigorian in her Met debut.\\n\\n\\u201cI kept saying to people, \\u2018You know, I\\u2019m a DJ, but I\\u2019m actually an opera singer.\\u2019 And the more I said it, the more I was like: \\u2019Am I really an opera singer?\\u2019\\u201d Tetelman recalled of his singing sabbatical.\\n\\nSo he gave himself six months.\\n\\n\\u201cI just sold everything. I sold all my equipment. All my speakers, all my turntables \\u2014 everything \\u2014 and just focused,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nBorn in Chile, Tetelman was adopted at about 7 months and grew up in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. He got a degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 2011 and considered himself a baritone.\\n\\nTetelman moved on to the Mannes School of Music for a graduate program where he was told his upper register was his future but struggled with even audition standards. Overcome with frustration, he headed to the downtown nightlife scene in 2013.\\n\\n\\u201cIt just wasn\\u2019t \\u2014 it wasn\\u2019t clicking. I threw it all away,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nAfter concluding that club life wasn\\u2019t a future, Tetelman began listening to recordings of Luciano Pavarotti, Enrico Caruso, Franco Corelli and Jonas Kaufmann to understand how they used their voices. Working with Mark Schnaible and Patricia McCaffrey, a husband-and-wife vocal coach team, he began building his tenor technique in 2015.\\n\\n\\u201cThis young man is wildly talented,\\u201d Schnaible said.\\n\\nBy his mid-20s, Tetelman thought himself too old for professional training programs, so he found an agent. He sang Eisenstein in Johann Strauss II\\u2019s \\u201cDie Fledermaus (The Bat)\\u201d at the Martina Arroyo Foundation\\u2019s young artists program in 2016. He then paid a few hundred dollars to attend an open call casting audition. That led to the role of Rodolfo in Puccini\\u2019s \\u201cLa Boh\\u00e8me\\u201d at the Fujian Grand Theatre in China in 2017.\\n\\nHe was hired for \\u201cBoh\\u00e8me\\u201d in November 2018 at the English National Opera, where all performances are in English.\\n\\nTetelman prepared by singing in \\u201cLa Boheme Warhola\\u201d \\u2014 an adaptation of the classic that shifts to Andy Warhol\\u2019s The Factory studio \\u2014 with Pittsburgh Festival Opera at the Falk Auditorium, a 360-seat school theater. Around the same time, agent Alan Green arranged for Tetelman to take over Rodolfo for a concert performance at the Boston Symphony Orchestra\\u2019s Tanglewood Festival after Piotr Becza\\u0142a withdrew to replace Roberto Alagna at the Bayreuth Festival\\u2019s \\u201cLohengrin.\\u201d\\n\\nThat raised Tetelman\\u2019s profile before he headed to the London Coliseum for the revival of Jonathan Miller\\u2019s 2009 staging, a key accelerant of his career.\\n\\n\\u201cThe production and the theater are wonderful. \\u2018La Boh\\u00e8me\\u2019 in English is disgusting,\\u201d Tetelman recalled vividly.\\n\\nA dashing 6-foot-4 with dark hair and a wide smile, he became an in-demand singer for Puccini.\\n\\n\\u201cHe has a very solid top. When he sings soft, which I always encourage, especially in the very intimate moments, there\\u2019s a tenderness,\\u201d conductor Speranza Scappucci said.\\n\\nOn the night of Tetelman\\u2019s Met debut on March 26, an audience member tossed a bouquet he caught on the fly.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s certainly a very, very charismatic presence and the audiences are responding,\\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said.\\n\\nTetelman made his Salzburg Festival debut last summer in Krzysztof Warlikowski\\u2019s \\u201cMacbeth.\\u201d The staging opened in an obstetrician\\u2019s office with children wearing black and yellow patches warning of radiation.\\n\\n\\u201cYou had to be on like mushrooms or something to really understand it,\\u201d Tetelman said, quickly adding, \\u201cIt was one of the most amazing experiences I\\u2019ve had. ... I think working with him was actually a really inspiring moment for me.\\u201d\\n\\nFuture roles include Turiddu in Mascagni\\u2019s \\u201cCavalleria Rusticana\\u201d and a title role in Saint-Sa\\u00ebns\\u2019 \\u201cSamson et Dalila\\u201d along with the heavier Puccini parts of Dick Johnson in \\u201cLa Fanciulla del West (Girl of the Golden West)\\u201d and des Grieux in \\u201cManon Lescaut.\\u201d He\\u2019d like to take on Strauss\\u2019 Apollo in \\u201cDaphne\\u201d and Bacchus in \\u201cAriadne auf Naxos\\u201d one day.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to book actually less and less Puccini just because I\\u2019ve booked so much,\\u201d Tetelman said.\",\n          \"CNN \\u2014\\n\\nAs war movies go, \\u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\\u201d ends up in a kind of no-man\\u2019s land, draping elements of \\u201cMission: Impossible,\\u201d \\u201cInglourious Basterds\\u201d and director Guy Ritchie\\u2019s brand of violent action-comedy over the bones of a fascinating World War II true story. The underwritten, somewhat messy results are broadly entertaining if not fully seaworthy from a dramatic point of view.\\n\\nGiven that Henry Cavill (having entered his spy phase, between this and \\u201cArgylle\\u201d) and Alan Ritchson (\\u201cReacher\\u201d) bring their considerable brawn to the festivities, it\\u2019s somewhat ironic how thin and un-fleshed-out the characters are. While Ritchie might have been in a hurry to get into the action, it comes at the expense of an investment in the individuals beyond the dire nature of the plot.\\n\\nThat plot involves a secretive version of a nascent special-ops team \\u2013 given the go-ahead by Winston Churchill himself (an unrecognizable Rory Kinnear) \\u2013 a real group whose existence remained classified for decades before being detailed in a 2014 book. Adding a pinch of \\u201cThe Dirty Dozen,\\u201d the squad operated under the leadership of a bad-attitude agent, Cavill\\u2019s Gus March-Phillipps, who had to be sprung from military prison to lead the group.\\n\\nKnown as Operation Postmaster, the mission played a vital role in the war effort, seeking to sideline the supply chain outfitting Germany\\u2019s U-boats, knowing that the submarines\\u2019 presence in the Atlantic had, among other things, helped keep the US out of the war. Specifically, March-Phillipps and company are tasked with blowing up a supply vessel that requires overcoming enormous odds, understanding that the British government will disavow them, and the Germans will torture and kill them.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' takes on the Nazis 01:53 - Source: CNN\\n\\nThe central quintet (rounded out by Henry Golding of \\u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\\u201d Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Alex Pettyfer) also receives logistical help from a female spy (\\u201c3 Body Problem\\u201d star Eiza Gonz\\u00e1lez) tasked with seducing and distracting the German commander (\\u201cBasterds\\u2019\\u201d Til Schweiger) and a resourceful businessman (Babs Olusanmokun) operating out of the port, on the Spanish island Fernando Po, where the boat is docked.\\n\\nFrom the opening sequence, Ritchie (who previously teamed with Cavill on \\u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\u201d) works from the well-founded theory that the cathartic act of killing Nazis during World War II doesn\\u2019t require explanation. In keeping with a long tradition of movies built around dangerous wartime assignments (\\u201cThe Guns of Navarone\\u201d also comes to mind), the best-laid plans never quite follow the script and inevitably call for improvisation.\\n\\nStill, the desire to adapt the film to fit producer Jerry Bruckheimer\\u2019s blockbuster filmography and Ritchie\\u2019s kinetic style keeps dragging it in that direction and away from the grit that would bolster its historical underpinnings. The closing crawl provides a clearer sense of those, in a way that merely heightens a wish Ritchie and his script collaborators had toned down the embellishment.\\n\\nThose who choose to can enjoy the movie strictly for its red-carpet-friendly cast and muscular mix of a caper with check-your-brain-at-the-door-type action. Even so, a bit more brains to go with all that brawn would have improved things considerably, and maybe even made these gentlemen (and lady) operators seem a bit more special.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\\u201d premieres April 19 in US theaters.

We will go through that but that\\u2019s pretty much all.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not that Mo [Salah] didn\\u2019t miss chances before in his life, that\\u2019s a part of the game. The penalty was super-convincing, a super penalty, then the next chance, that was obviously unlucky but it is not the first time he missed a chance like that.\\u201d\\n\\nJ\\u00fcrgen Klopp took Salah off in the second half of the match. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters\\n\\nAfter Klopp announced his decision to step down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season, many involved with the club had hoped to send off the 56-year-old German with another European trophy.\\n\\nFans had earmarked the Europa League final in Dublin, Ireland, as Klopp\\u2019s potential last game in charge, but those plans came crashing down on a frustrating night in Italy.\\n\\nKlopp insisted the game was not lost in the return leg, but in the disappointing 3-0 defeat at Anfield last week.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very easy to congratulate Atalanta because they deserved to go through. When you win a tie against us 3-1, especially in this way, you deserve to go through, absolutely,\\u201d added Klopp after his last Euorpean game in charge of Liverpool.\\n\\nElsewhere on Thursday, fellow Premier League side West Ham crashed out of the Europa League quarterfinals after losing 3-1 on aggregate to Bayer Leverkusen.\\n\\nIt followed the defeats suffered by Arsenal and Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, meaning there will be no English team in the semifinals of either competition for the first time since the 2014/15 season, per Opta.\\n\\nEnglish Premier League title race\\n\\nWith such disappointment in Europe for English clubs, all attention now turns back to the Premier League title race.\\n\\nAfter Liverpool and Arsenal suffered shock defeats on Sunday, reigning champion Manchester City moved top of the table and look favorites to go on to win the title.\\n\\nBut with both Arsenal and Liverpool just two points behind, there is all to play for with just six games remaining.\\n\\nKlopp, hoping to leave Liverpool with the perfect present of a league title, said his side can now fully focus on the remainder of the campaign. It faces Fulham in its next league game on Sunday.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have a few days to recover, we will do that, and then will travel the day after tomorrow to London and will play Fulham, which will be tricky but we will give our absolute all.

(Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nNike CEO John Donahoe acknowledged Friday that the company moved too far away from wholesale partners like Macy's and DSW in its quest to become a retailer that primarily sells merchandise to shoppers through its own stores and website.\\n\\n\\\"We recognize that in our movement toward digital, we had over-rotated away from wholesale a little more than we intended,\\\" Donahoe told CNBC's Sara Eisen from Paris. \\\"We've corrected that. We're investing heavily with our retail partners. They were all here over the last couple of days; they're very excited about the innovation pipeline.\\\"\\n\\nOver the past several years, Nike has worked to transform its business from a brand that primarily sold its sneakers and clothes in department stores and specialty athletic shops to one that does the bulk of its sales direct to consumers.\\n\\nThe strategy allowed Nike to earn far more from its sales and gain better insights about its customers through data collection. Over the last four years, Donahoe said Nike tripled its mobile and digital business from about 10% of overall sales to 30%.\\n\\nHowever, it's a tough strategy to pull off and one that can pressure margins in the short term. Shifting to a direct model is capital-intensive and saddled Nike with the headaches of returns and owned inventory, which had typically fallen on wholesale partners.\\n\\nOn top of that, department stores and specialty shops are massive customer acquisition engines. Without them, brands have to spend more on marketing, which has become more expensive and challenging to do online.\",\n          \"Washington CNN \\u2014\\n\\nOn Tuesday, late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel delivered another monologue making fun of former President Donald Trump.

disney s domestic parks to shutter but d amaro chair of disney s experiences division was confident guests would flood back in when the gates reopened his confidence was well founded d amaro s division is now disney s best performing segment rebounding and offering stability in recent quarters as disney shuffles to adapt its entertainment business to match consumer habits that changed after the pandemic on that quiet day in d amaro had been in charge of the parks experiences and consumer products division now just called experiences for only a little more than a year he took the helm when bob chapek was tapped as ceo in early d amaro spent much of those months dealing with substantial operating losses from global park closures a docked fleet of cruise ships and a plunge in hotel visits revenues fell in a nearly billion decrease from the billion the experiences division had tallied in the year before the pandemic then revenue dropped an additional in but a lot has changed in three years d amaro sitting in a conference room in burbank an hour north of disneyland and just a few miles from the heart of disney s theme park creative engine walt disney imagineering has much to brag about the experiences division posted record revenue of billion in fiscal a increase from the prior year operating income jumped to billion d amaro described the pandemic as an opportunity to take a breath and a time for his division to think about what we wanted the future to look like so as difficult as that situation was we saw it as a platform a new vantage point for us to look at the operation he said while its parks were shuttered disney continued construction of its avengers campus themed land in disneyland and touched up old favorites such as the king arthur carousel and it built new rides and refurbished others in the years that followed avengers campus at disneyland in california christian thompson disneyland resort world of frozen opened in hong kong disneyland in

adventure into san fransokyo square based on the animated hit big hero updating mickey s toon town at disneyland and making major transformations at epcot those investments coupled with new technology in mobile ordering and the ability for guests to pay to skip to the front of the line for certain rides have kept guests coming and boosted disney s earnings at a time when the entertainment division

frankly in experiences was the best performing part of disney s business accounting for of the company s total revenue but of its operating income meanwhile disney s entertainment division which includes its theatrical and streaming businesses represented of revenue but just of operating income the ability to get more out of the parks in recent years was crucial for ceo bob iger and disney s board as they tried to make the company more profitable and improve share performance on wednesday disney beat back activist investor nelson peltz s proxy fight reelecting its full board always innovating the division s strength is why disney has pledged to invest billion in experiences over the next years a key part of its strategy to keep the parks fresh and relevant in a competitive segment d amaro said about of that money will go toward new experiences in domestic and international parks along with cruise lines the other will go toward technology and infrastructure including maintenance of existing attractions innovation at theme parks has been a central goal since walt disney ran the company disney s founder used to say that its theme parks would never be finished and would evolve to meet consumer demand and changing tastes along with developments in technology walt disney imagineering has long been on the cutting edge of development its innovations from ride mechanics and animatronics to creature design and immersive architecture have made disney s parks a standout in the industry last year guests caught a glimpse of one of these innovations a trio of

developing to bring walking robotic characters to life walt disney imagineering s two legged walking character platform in the form of bdx a star wars droid disney engineers create the mechanics for the remote controlled droids to move and balance and work with animators to give those movements personality the robots were designed to have childlike curiosity reflected through cheeky head tilts and chirping beeps along with a special emote dubbed tantrum where their eyes glow red and they emit a high pitched squeal guests who visit galaxy s edge in the next three months may stumble across this trio as part of disney s season of the force they add to the regular roaming character meet and greets with the likes of rey chewbacca kylo ren and stormtroopers disney hopes hands on innovations such as the robots will keep guests coming those moments where there s a spark there s an emotion that s on full display where a guest is interacting with an attraction or a cast member or a character it s very real and genuine said d amaro that emotion was on display at the south by southwest conference in march when disney debuted a new iteration of its stuntronics robot this time in the form of judy hopps from zootopia this technology had previously been used to create the spider man leap stunt at avengers campus during the presentation imagineers showed the audience how the judy hopps robot

moved its legs to fit around his neck as a child would the simple motion programmed just for the presentation imagineers told cnbc captured something intrinsic to the human experience d amaro said those moments show why it s important for disney animators to be part of the development process as the imagineers craft new technologies the artists can help bring them to life it shows in disney s rebrand of splash mountain in both the california and florida parks the company is refurbishing the ride into tiana s bayou adventure which will feature dozens of animatronic characters from the princess and the frog a preview of walt disney imagineering s audio animatronics for the upcoming refresh of splash mountain tiana s bayou adventure disney imagineers have developed all electronic audio animatronics for the ride for characters such as lewis the trumpet playing alligator from the film disney revolutionized animatronics decades ago with its hydraulic or liquid fueled and pneumatic or air fueled systems but the electronic animatronics for tiana s bayou allow for more refined and precise movement making them appear more realistic similar animatronics can be seen in the rides smuggler s run and rise of the resistance in galaxy s edge interior pieces of some of the animatronics were crafted using d printing resulting in a lighter weight material telling stories in the parks disney s ambitions to grow its experiences unit hinge in part on making its attractions feel more real they continue to push the envelope of storytelling and creativity d amaro said of the imagineering team he cited the recently shuttered star wars galactic starcruiser a hotel and immersive experience that took guests on a two day voyage in space it was a hour interactive story that allowed fans to physically play in the star wars universe guests arrive aboard the chandrila star line s halcyon at star wars galactic starcruiser disney this is something that had never been done before d amaro said it was difficult to even explain to the public and i think it was incredibly brave for us to move into this space and this to me says imagineering is still at its best today high ticket prices deterred the average parkgoer and the galactic starcruiser shuttered in september still d amaro said the experiment was a learning opportunity for the company those learnings are being employed on the next experiences which we haven t even announced yet he said storytelling is at the heart of everything across disney s experiences division this extends to disney s cruise line and hotels as well as its video game business the company has a fleet of five cruise ships and plans to add three more by fiscal the disney wish which made its maiden voyage in was the first addition to the fleet in a decade and bet big on its powerhouse franchises to entice travelers to the high seas there s a frozen sing along dinner and a marvel dining experience as well as a star wars inspired hyperspace lounge the ship also has the first ever disney water ride attraction on board the aquamouse disney s frozen themed dinner show on the cruise ship wish disney matt stroshane this is something i think that s really important the idea of the disney difference d amaro said that this company works together as one is more powerful now than i think it ever has been whether it s entertainment co chair alan bergman in the studios creating a new property that we can then take to disney experiences and bring it to life and extend that story in brand new ways or franchises that are birthed out of the theme parks ',\n",

              " 'washington ap the house passed legislation saturday that would ban tiktok in the united states if the popular social media platform s china based owner doesn t sell its stake within a year but don t expect the app to go away anytime soon the decision by house republicans to include tiktok as part of a larger foreign aid package a priority for president joe biden with broad congressional support for ukraine and israel fast tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the senate a standalone bill with a shorter six month selling deadline passed the house in march by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both democrats and republicans voiced national security concerns about the app s owner the chinese technology firm bytedance ltd the modified measure passed by a vote now goes to the senate after negotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine months with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress legal challenges could extend that timeline even further the company has indicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it passes arguing it would deprive the app s millions of users of their first amendment rights tiktok has lobbied hard against the legislation pushing the app s million u s users many of whom are young to call congress and voice opposition but the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on capitol hill where there is broad concern about chinese threats to the u s and where few members use the platform themselves we will not stop fighting and advocating for you tiktok ceo shou zi chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app s users we will continue to do all we can including exercising our legal rights to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you the bill s quick path through congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because congress has taken a hands off approach to tech regulation for decades lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online safeguard users privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms among other measures but the tiktok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about china members of both parties along with intelligence officials have worried that chinese authorities could force bytedance to hand over american user data or direct the company to suppress or boost tiktok content favorable to its interests tiktok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the chinese government and has said it has not shared u s user data with chinese authorities the u s government has not publicly provided evidence that shows tiktok shared u s user data with the chinese government or tinkered with the company s popular algorithm which influences what americans see the company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the u s in november a federal judge blocked a montana law that would ban tiktok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued in federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then president donald trump to ban tiktok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights his administration brokered a deal that would have had u s corporations oracle and walmart take a large stake in tiktok the sale never went through for a number of reasons one was china which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers dozens of states and the federal government have put in place tiktok bans on government devices texas ban was challenged last year by the knight first amendment institute at columbia university which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities in december a federal judge ruled in favor of the state organizations such as the american civil liberties union have backed the app congress cannot take away the rights of over million americans who use tiktok to express themselves engage in political advocacy and access information from around the world said jenna leventoff a lawyer for the group since mid march tiktok has spent million on tv ads opposing the legislation according to adimpact an advertising tracking firm the ads have included a range of content creators including a nun extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the first amendment the company has also encouraged its users to contact congress and some lawmakers have received profanity laced calls it is unfortunate that the house of representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of million americans devastate million businesses and shutter a platform that contributes billion to the u s economy annually said alex haurek a spokesman for the company california rep ro khanna a democrat voted against the legislation he said he thinks there could have been less restrictive ways to go after the company that wouldn t result in a total ban or threaten free speech i think it s not going to be well received khanna said it s a sign of the beltway being out of touch with where voters are nadya okamoto a content creator who has roughly million followers on tiktok said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing so much anger and anxiety about the bill and how it s going to impact their lives the year old whose company august sells menstrual products and is known for her

incident will push back its financial recovery and cost it million in compensation to its airline customers boeing reported a core operating loss of million or a share from the million it lost on that basis a year earlier that was significantly less than analysts forecast of a share in the quarter but the improvement came from outside its key commercial airplanes unit where losses from operations nearly doubled to billion revenue tumbled billion or to billion as the problems at the airplane maker resulted in a sharp drop in deliveries of jets to its airline customers the company gets most of its money from sales of commercial planes only upon deliveries to customers the slightly better than expected financial results don t make up for a company struggling with questions from congress regulators and the traveling public about the quality and safety of its aircraft it is not only scrambling to repair its badly damaged reputation but also to satisfy airline customers being hurt by not receiving the aircraft they had been promised boeing said it is taking the necessary steps to fix the quality issues but those fixes will continue to cause additional losses and missed delivery targets in the months ahead boeing said it would produce fewer max jets than it originally planned for the rest of this year as it tries to fix problems on its assembly lines production of its larger dreamliner will also be limited by supplier issues it said we will take the time necessary to strengthen our quality and safety management systems and this work will position us for a stronger and more stable future said ceo dave calhoun who announced during the quarter his plans to leave his post by the end of the year the company said the results were hurt by the million in compensation to

announced they had reached compensation agreements with boeing the incident has sparked a series of investigations into boeing by the national transportation safety board the federal aviation

employees who raise concerns about those issues including congressional hearings boeing has said it has made a new commitment to improving its quality and safety issues and that it wants employees with concerns to bring them forward calhoun said he s confident that boeing will be able to make the changes it needs to return to profitability for the first time since but he said the changes it will be making will delay the timeline to be profitable once again while this effort will slow our recovery timing we are now seeing proof points that give us confidence that we ll begin to stabilize and improve performance moving forward he said on the company s investors call the company would not give any guidance for how much money it will lose this year or exactly when it expects to be profitable calhoun said the company is confident with its goal of producing positive cash flow of billion a year although he said it is now looking to do that later in the to window it had set as its goal we are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to make certain our regulators our customers and most importantly our employees and the public are confident in boeing he said it is

the biden a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile house next year fifteen of those seats are in states that biden won in the exception is nebraska s nd district represented by gop rep don bacon there are five seats in california four in new york two in arizona and one apiece in new jersey oregon

congressional support for ukraine and israel fast tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the senate a standalone bill with a shorter six month selling deadline passed the house in march by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both democrats and republicans voiced national security concerns about the app s owner the chinese technology firm bytedance ltd the modified measure passed by a vote now goes to the senate after negotiations that lengthened the timeline for the company to sell to nine months with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress legal challenges could extend that timeline even further the company has indicated that it would likely go to court to try and block the law if it passes arguing it would deprive the app s millions of users of their first amendment rights tiktok has lobbied hard against the legislation pushing the app s million u s users many of whom are young to call congress and voice opposition but the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on capitol hill where there is broad concern about chinese threats to the u s and where few members use the platform themselves we will not stop fighting and advocating for you tiktok ceo shou zi chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app s users we will continue to do all we can including exercising our legal rights to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you the bill s quick path through congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because congress has taken a hands off approach to tech regulation for decades lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online safeguard users privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms among other measures but the tiktok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about china members of both parties along with intelligence officials have worried that chinese authorities could force

civil fraud trial judgment against him his adult sons and his company if he can t somehow find the money by monday new york attorney general letitia james may begin seizing some of trump s assets to finance his obligation to the state she has laid the groundwork with court filings that suggest trump s seven springs estate and golf course in westchester county new york could be among her first targets the attorney general is ready to go they are ready to go after his money to try to fulfill the judgment adam leitman bailey a real estate attorney who sued trump seven times told cnn s erin burnett the question is how hard it is going to be to collect while this is primarily a crisis about trump s business and personal wealth it is creating real political implications given his status as the presumptive republican presidential nominee no other candidate has ever faced such a distraction in the middle of an election campaign and that s separate from the former commander in chief s parallel constellation of criminal cases that will dominate the run up to election day and potentially add to the tumult of his second presidency if he beats president joe biden and yet trump s continued resilience as a candidate remains on display as featured in two new cnn polls conducted by ssrs that were released on friday one of which shows the former president leading in michigan and in a dead heat with biden in pennsylvania trump s increasingly alarmed posts on social media on thursday offered a window into his desperation and they showed how every one of his cases now has a similar defense he claims he s not guilty of breaking the law but is the victim of endless political persecution election interference trump for instance wrote on his truth social network he complained that putting up money to permit an appeal was very expensive and he sent out a fundraising appeal to supporters titled keep your filthy hands off of trump tower on friday morning the former president wrote on truth social that he has almost five hundred million dollars in cash chris kise an attorney for trump later clarified that trump was referring to money reported on his campaign disclosure forms that he s built up through years of owning and managing successful businesses not cash on hand even one of his legal cases would have been enough to drive any conventional candidate from the race long ago but trump leads many national and swing state polls a sign that his attempts to spin his flurry of legal duress as persecution are working among many republican voters his standing in the race also reflects the daunting problems shadowing biden s reelection bid as the unpopular president tries to convince americans that a recovering economy is healthier than they perceive in their daily lives given expensive trips to grocery stores and the high interest rates that make housing and other major purchases so daunting while trump s enemies would relish his property portfolio being gutted by james the political impact of such a humiliation would be uncertain the resulting furor might add fuel to the ex president s claims he is being unfairly targeted by democratic prosecutors because of who he is one of his closest allies rep elise stefanik of new york is already trying to foster such an impression by slamming what she claimed was a fundamentally un american campaign against him at the same time however the latest controversy surrounding trump may begin to remind moderate republican and independent voters of the daily chaos that characterized his years in office the biden campaign has long maintained this will inevitably shift voters the president s way even if there is little evidence in the polls so far of that happening a long list of legal challenges the ex president s struggle to come up with funds after multiple insurance firms declined to underwrite the bond is a humiliating spectacle for a former president whose image as a masterful property magnate is central to his public brand the frenzied search for money raises painful questions about the extent of trump s liquid wealth about which he has long boasted it s also an undignified plight for someone who could be occupying the white house in months and suggests troubling conflicts of interest if he turns to private donors or overseas sources to find the money in an th hour dash for cash the implications of the rush to finance the bond have caused panic in the ex president s inner circle cnn s kaitlan collins reported this week but as grave as it is the drama around the bond payment is only one of the multiple perils confronting trump on thursday cnn reported that fani willis the district attorney of fulton county georgia plans to push hard for a trial before november s election in a bid to thwart trump s delaying tactics despite narrowly escaping being thrown off her election interference case following an intimate relationship with a fellow prosecutor given the complexity of the racketeering case which includes an array of former trump associates as co defendants any such timeline feels wildly optimistic i really think this is mostly just posturing by the da s office michael moore a former us attorney told cnn on thursday and while willis wants a trial date soon she is still not completely secure the judge who allowed her to continue on the case despite rebuking her conduct has granted the defendants the right to appeal his decision elsewhere in trump s multi city legal quagmire judge arthur engoron who oversaw the new york civil fraud case that trump lost imposed new constraints on the the trump organization by expanding the reach of the monitor who is providing court ordered oversight the move means the firm will not for instance be able to move large amounts of money or take any significant business steps without scrutiny a departure for a company that has always played by its own set of rules also in new york the manhattan district attorney s office called on a judge to impose no further delay in the trial over trump s payment of hush money to the adult film actress stormy daniels during the election campaign the trial had been set to start on monday but was postponed after new documents surfaced and the former president is now asking for a day delay judge juan merchan has postponed the case at least until april and is due to hold a hearing on discovery issues on monday that could also produce a firm trial date all of this is unfolding as other trump trials including federal prosecutions on election interference and the alleged mishandling of classified documents are on hold as he tries to run out the clock ahead of november s election with frenzied litigation and the filing of appeals the supreme court is due to hear his sweeping claim of presidential immunity for acts committed in office next month and a ruling is not expected until late june the decision could have important implications for the criminal cases that trump is facing as he seeks a second term yet in one ray of light for the ex president this week his net worth could soon be set to soar with the merger of his media properties including the truth social network and digital world acquisition corp a blank check firm the move would make trump by far the largest shareholder of the merged publicly traded company and would on paper add billions of dollars to his net worth in theory this is the kind of windfall that could help trump at a moment of extreme financial distress and at a moment when his campaign fundraising is falling well short of biden s in practice however conditions of a deal mean that the ex president could not liquidate his shares to ease his cash crunch immediately and if he were to sell the price of the company s stock would likely tumble how james plans to extract the state s due from trump state lawyers filed judgments in westchester county north of manhattan on march a week after engoron s civil fraud judgment finding that trump his adult sons and the trump organization had committed massive fraud largely through overvaluations of property to secure favorable loans from banks and better rates from insurance companies the former president s lawyers disclosed this week that he had failed to find an insurance company to underwrite a bond that would guarantee the state s financial stake in the case while the appeal process plays out trump has already filed a nearly million bond in another case after losing a defamation claim to the writer e jean carroll which he also plans to appeal trump s attorneys have warned that any attempt to sell off properties to meet the judgment would cause him permanent financial damage since buyers would demand fire sale prices there s also another reason why an attempt by james to seize his assets could be problematic for the ex president and is a far more complicated proposition for the attorney general than it might first appear some of trump s buildings and properties are sure to be financed by mortgages and other financial arrangements that will be difficult to unravel in the event of a sale the proceeds would go first to make good the lenders meaning that a substantial chunk of the trump empire may need to be sold off to reach the near half billion dollar figure owed to the state one option that trump might be forced to consider is bankruptcy a route he has used several times in his flamboyant and checkered business career and that may allow him to dispose of assets in an organized way but collins reported this week that he has privately expressed opposition to that path and it remains the least likely way out for now ultimately the stigma of enduring such a process so close to a general election might be too much for the ex president to bear and it would add to concerns that the former president isn t fit for a return to the oval office whatever the resolution the multiple dramas again strike at the question at the heart of this election do americans really want four more years of the mayhem scandal and challenges to the law that rage around the former president week after week ',\n",

scheme to pay off women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs is expected to begin with opening statements on monday the task ahead in new york for trump is clear convince seven men and five women on the jury he is innocent of the charges he faces in battlegrounds like north carolina the challenge for trump is less straightforward but similarly daunting he must persuade voters in these states to overlook whatever details emerge from his new york trial when determining the country s next president that includes evidence of alleged hush money payments as well as testimony from his former lawyer and fixer michael cohen a former playboy playmate and an adult film star appearing in greensboro north carolina ahead of the state s primary last month trump remarked on his legal peril

make sure people continue to hear about the case from him in theatrical news conferences in front of courthouse cameras and aggressively posting on social media trump repeatedly lashed out at the

supported by those who witnessed him walk out trump posted on truth social that i was praying not sleeping when multiple news outlets reported the former president appeared to doze off during the

than campaign trump also kept a notably light political schedule throughout the gop primary when the legal cases against him had yet to reach this stage regardless of where trump is spending his time

badly both times but is on the ballot again in this time as a democrat seeking the senate seat being vacated by joe manchin blankenship has plenty of baggage heading into the may democratic primary beyond his history of political losses he s perhaps best known in this coal producing state as the former chief executive of massey energy who spent a year in federal prison for conspiring to violate mine safety laws before an explosion at his west virginia coal mine killed men in with their threadbare senate majority on the line in this year s elections democrats are already pessimistic about their chances in west virginia where manchin was the rare member of their party to find success in a state that republican former president donald trump carried by nearly percentage points in but a blankenship victory in the primary could prove especially problematic for the party leaving democrats with an unpopular candidate with a complicated past in business and politics the party and its union allies are working to avoid that scenario earlier this week manchin endorsed wheeling mayor glenn elliott who was an aide to legendary democratic sen robert c byrd and is unapologetically pro union state democratic party chair mike pushkin argues blankenship isn t a democrat and is fond of referring to him as federal prisoner a reference to his identification number while incarcerated and cecil roberts president of the united mine workers union which endorsed manchin in and said seeing blankenship file for the senate as a democrat may be the most fraudulent and cynical move he s ever seen and that s saying a lot roberts quipped if he s a democrat then i m batman in an interview blankenship argued that it s the democratic party that s inauthentic and that he s the candidate most aligned with west virginians basically i hope to deliver the message that when west virginians vote for a typical democrat they re voting for the policies that they don t believe in he said that s actually the reason they abandoned the party to begin with in the democratic primary elliott and blankenship will face marine corps veteran and grassroots organizer zach shrewsbury jim justice the current governor and a wealthy coal operator and rep alex mooney a pro trump republican are competing for the gop nomination in order to win blankenship must overcome the toxic atmosphere created by his highly publicized trial prosecutors portrayed blankenship as a micromanager who put profits above safety and made their case using phone calls blankenship secretly recorded in his massey office on those calls blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept confidential and would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if a mine fatality occurred investigations found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited coal dust and methane gas broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a flare up to become an inferno an outspoken critic of then president barack obama blankenship along with his defense team was ordered by a federal judge during his trial not to tell jurors he was being persecuted by democrats manchin was governor when the massey energy mine blankenship ran blew up by the time the ex ceo was sentenced to a year in prison manchin was a u s senator no sentence is severe enough he said on the day blankenship was sentenced blankenship still maintains that natural gas caused the tragedy and blamed obama s mine health safety administration for ventilation changes prior to the explosion prosecutors noted that regulators wouldn t allow the mine s old ventilation standard because of a fire that killed two people at another massey mine in west virginia once one of appalachia s wealthiest men blankenship has spent thousands on lawsuits alleging he has been the victim of defamation and character assassination all of which have been rejected by courts including the u s supreme court before seeking office blankenship spent millions backing gop candidates including nearly million in to help defeat a democratic incumbent and elect the first republican to the state supreme court in more than years his unabashed bankrolling of west virginia republicans inspired a john grisham novel the appeal so far west virginia voters have given no indication they take him seriously as a candidate the republicans rejected him so i m pretty sure the democrat party will handily reject him as well said shrewsbury whose grandfather was a coal miner shrewsbury said he has no respect for blankenship adding that he s not someone who should be in this race shrewsbury and elliott stress the importance of investing in green energy technology and criticized laws like right to work passed by the state s gop supermajority to weaken union power we need to fight for the worker not the company store shrewsbury said manchin also has a tenuous relationship with justice the gop race s likely frontrunner justice who owns the swanky greenbrier hotel and dozens of other businesses was recruited by manchin to run as a democrat for governor before switching parties at a rally for trump justice s mining companies have been scrutinized for alleged safety violations and unpaid taxes and he s also been sued by retirees of his coal companies over prescription drug coverage interruptions elliott said justice isn t what west virginia needs he s protecting coal that s what he s going to say elliott said ask the coal miners who work for him how much he s protecting the coal miners he said struggling people living in dying coal counties want realistic solutions look there s room to protect the coal jobs that we have but also admit that the world is changing and that we have to be investing in ourselves and not just expecting some outside industry be it an extractive industry or anything else to save us mindi stewart whose husband stanley goose stewart was working at upper big

nominee s entire approach to business and politics or the way he s promised to behave if voters send him back to the white house the new york lawyer coined his phrase during a tense hearing on whether trump violated the terms of the gag order in social media blasts reposts and comments claiming the jury was full of biased liberals and targeting two potential key witnesses his ex lawyer michael cohen and adult film star stormy daniels and in remarks in an interview recorded before tuesday s hearing but that was broadcast as judge juan merchan considers whether to punish trump the ex president was at it again michael cohen is a convicted liar and he s got no credibility whatsoever trump said in an interview with wpvi philadelphia only six days into the trial trump is doing what he always does pushing the rules and conventions of the law and accepted behavior to service his own narrative of victimization he s placed at the core of his campaign video ad feedback viewer asks why judge can t increase trump gag order fines legal expert weighs in source cnn trump could face a ladder of escalating sanctions prosecutors now want merchan to fine trump for each of alleged violations of the gag order and to warn that imprisonment could be an option if he continues to flout restrictions cnn s john miller reported tuesday that the secret service court officers and the new york city department of corrections have quietly consulted on what to do if trump ends up being jailed for contempt of court that remedy remains a distant one for now but any eventual step in that direction cannot be ruled out since no judge can allow a defendant to mock his authority in what is in essence a show of contempt for the rule of law judge merchan has to have control of his courtroom former judge and current cooley law school professor jeffrey swartz told jim sciutto on cnn max he cannot allow someone who is under a gag order to basically say i don t care what you think judge i am going to do what i want to do it s almost inconceivable that any other criminal defendant would get away with lacerating the judge and his court in the way that trump has done on his truth social network in interviews and in his remarks to cameras outside the court trump claims the gag order stifles his right to free speech and to campaign as a presumptive party nominee but that is blatantly false the order is narrow even if it was extended by the judge to cover his family following social media attacks by the former president on merchan s daughter on tuesday merchan grew visibly frustrated with trump s lawyers when they insisted that their client was trying hard to comply with the order without offering any evidence at one point in what quickly turned into a disastrous hearing for trump s

counsel todd blanche merchan is a pretty cool character he doesn t get easily riled up she told cnn s erin burnett they were going at it trying and failing to hold trump to account merchan like most judges may not be used to such affronts but he s the latest in a long line of judges public officials political aides and business associates not to mention us laws and the constitution to try to constrain the former president and while a dispute over one partial gag order might seem like a small wrinkle in an individual case it conveys a wider truth about trump s impact on american life there s a common theme in all trump s four criminal cases other legal quagmires and the single presidential term that produced two impeachments he constantly refuses to comply with laws that apply to every other american the implicit underpinning of all trump s pending trials including two over his attempt to overturn the election one over his hoarding of classified documents and other civil and fraud cases is the same it s that every american is equal in the eyes of the law a principle that even applies to ex presidents but trump constantly infringes this bedrock value that is the pillar of the legal system and he will do so in the most audacious of ways on the biggest stage later this week when the us supreme court hears his sweeping claim that ex presidents are immune from prosecution for acts they committed in office the argument is an attempt to derail special counsel jack smith s stalled federal election interference case against trump the former president posted on truth social on sunday without presidential immunity a president will not be able to properly function or make decisions but trump is reaching for protections that would absolve the executive office of the presidency of legal accountability for criminal acts a privilege that no other commander in chief in nearly two and a half centuries has enjoyed and which appears to contradict the founding principles of a nation that rebelled against a monarch who was above the law most legal scholars believe there s no merit to his claims a stance validated by a court of appeals ruling against trump in washington dc but any decision by the supreme court to suggest even some limited areas of presidential immunity could end up changing the scope of the office itself video ad feedback george conway on what struck him about trump s gag order hearing source cnn trump seems to consider he s above the law this sense that trump feels he s not covered by the same rules as everyone else shines through all of his legal cases in which he s pleaded not guilty as well as his other escapades he s the first president in history to lose an election but insist that he won based on false and debunked claims of mass fraud he saw nothing wrong as president with phoning officials in georgia and asking them to find votes that did not exist so he could try to overturn president joe biden s win in the critical swing state in the ex president insisted the call was perfect the same phrase he used to describe his attempt to coerce ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky into announcing an investigation into the biden family in a conversation that led to his first impeachment the impulse to ignore gag orders and most accepted understandings of the limits of presidential power seems to spring from the same contempt for the rule of law that led trump to allegedly mishandle troves of classified documents at his mar a lago estate and to claim they belonged to him and not the country he s also awaiting trial in this case in which he s pleaded not guilty a sense that the law only applies to other people may have also informed the ex president s overvaluing of his properties to secure preferential treatment from banks and insurance firms an assumption countermanded by his loss in a near half a billion dollar civil fraud trial judgement against him the trump organization and his adult sons earlier this year while trump s obliviousness to constraints horrifies his opponents his willingness to tear down legal and political institutions is the key to his appeal to millions of supporters in his bid to win

committee to try to reelect him because he s worried about trump s pledge to devote his possible second term to retribution he warned trump doesn t care a whit about the constitution about the rule of

              " 'cnn the republican national committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters phones on behalf of new co chair lara trump saying democrats committed massive fraud in the election it s the latest example of how the rnc under the former president s daughter in law is perpetuating lies about the election even as prominent republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in we all know the problems no photo ids unsecured ballot drop boxes mass mailing of ballots and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place the rnc call said if democrats have their way your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn t even an american citizen the claim of massive fraud in the election marks a significant shift in messaging for the rnc because lies about the election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since donald trump left office but the call s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by lara trump who was elected as co chair in early march as part of donald trump s takeover of the gop lara trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims according to a cnn kfile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president i m sure you agree with co chair trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the election to ever happen again said the call which was obtained by cnn s kfile from the anti robocall application nomorobo which estimated calls were sent with the message from april it comes amid previous cnn reporting about the rnc asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring the rnc denied any such litmus test existed lara trump and new chair michael whatley succeeded drew mckissick and ronna mcdaniel who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the rnc handled claims of fraud around the election cnn previously reported there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the election as even some state gop election officials and former trump attorney general william barr have acknowledged the former president and his supporters filed more than court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them and they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail but in the years since the election lara trump has continued to push claims of fraud her comments have been in line with those of her father in law who s successfully reshaped the gop in his image and easily secured his third straight gop nomination this year polling for example shows that a majority of gop voters think the election result was illegitimate a cnn poll released last september found that of republicans said president joe biden s did not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency from november to february lara trump propagated the narrative of democratic cheating in the presidential election and even after she was elected co chair and said claims of a stolen election are in the past she didn t repudiate those baseless accusations well i think we re past that i think that s in the past we learned a lot certainly we took a lot of notes trump said in an nbc interview when asked whether claims of a stolen election would be the official position of the rnc in she went on to tout lawsuits across states to ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote while raising questions about pandemic era voting procedures during the election in the same interview trump also added the gop needed to trust mail in voting neither the rnc nor lara trump responded to multiple requests for comment lara trump speaks at the republican national committee spring meeting on march in houston cecile clocheret afp getty images a long history of spreading election lies as recently as february lara trump said she did not believe biden received million votes in the election does anyone actually believe that in million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get people to attended events that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections she said at a trump event in south carolina just days before she announced her campaign for rnc co chair no we don t believe that on her internet show and podcast and in public events she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the election on an episode of her show that aired on december trump agreed with her co hosts that the election did not pass the smell test and falsely suggested that dead voters helped biden win now i don t know if this is true but somebody sent me this donald trump got million votes there are million registered voters in the united states if every single registered voter went out and voted which we know is basically impossible doesn t happen there would only be million votes left for joe biden so how the heck did he get million votes she said the comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote you re discriminating against all the dead people lara how dare you said one co host oh yeah that s right that s true she responded a cnn analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim debunking the misinformation spread by trump supporters online in the aftermath of the results the election saw a record breaking turnout with million people casting their votes as reported by the us census bureau this marked the highest voter participation of the st century with of eligible citizens aged and older voting later in the episode trump said i think that democrats know that the republicans are not gonna let it stand they re not gonna certify votes for joe biden and it is likely that they will be voting for donald trump for a second term in an episode of her podcast weeks earlier she claimed the odds of biden winning in swing states were one in one quadrillion to the fourth power as mail in ballots were counted failing to cite a statistical analysis though biden narrowly lost with in person voters of voters voted by mail in as votes were counted biden pulled ahead according to an analysis from pew research though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process lara trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously we gotta make up so much for all the cheating trump said on her podcast in september we know the democrats love to do that we need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they re like oh my god we can t do a a m spike with this we re never gonna make it ',\n",

              " 'cnn those within esports often get tired with constant comparisons with traditional sports but the increasingly popular world of competitive gaming can often be an example for those more historic sports to follow while the industry as a whole is still male dominated organizations have launched projects in the hope of creating a more diverse gaming environment an example of this is the valorant game changers initiative which looks to provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players valorant is a first person shooting game developed by riot games of league of legends fame and has approximately million players logging in each month the game changers series runs alongside the main competition and looks to foster marginalized talent in a safe environment away from any potential harassment riot games senior brand manager vera wienken has worked closely on launching the initiative and says it s already been a success it is very important to us to have real representation of the community within esports within our pro players coaches managers she told cnn sport therefore we founded game changers and really hope to see that in the future esports overall becomes more diverse read esports is on the rise in africa and these two kenyans are leading the charge video ad feedback meet the uae s first female esports team source cnn you don t need to sing it to the world wienken says representation is key to attracting and maintaining female participation in valorant and esports in general valorant itself is a relatively new game and wienken thinks its format and narrative open itself up to a more diverse audience the characters you can play as for example don t necessarily conform to gender stereotypes and this helps make the game more accessible says wienken there s a lack of role models she added when asked why the industry is still attracting less women than men what we would like to see and what s happening already which is amazing is these women pro players are becoming role models for others and sharing their path sharing their story so that women know and find their entry points valorant emea host yinsu collins is one of the many to have suffered from online harassment during her career in esports but she says she s developed a thick skin in order to ignore it the journalist who previously worked in traditional sports media says valorant has helped educate people within the industry of the discrimination marginalized groups face i don t think i ve ever seen a title that has produced and invested in a female scene this quickly she told cnn sport the way riot were like we re going to prioritize the women s side we re not going to wait three or four years to kind of give you guys a big tournament we re just going to do it right off the bat i just think the dedication the investment obviously you can see the way riot is prioritizing having diversity and you don t need to sing it to the world you just do it through your actions read how esports has helped its fans get through lockdown those within esports hope for a day when gender is no longer spoken about courtesy riot games what does progress look like while collins has been sent negative messages on social media she has also seen people reflect on their past actions she says she occasionally gets messages from boys who want to apologize for certain things they ve said or the way they ve behaved online in the past hopefully in a few years maybe a decade s time we wouldn t even have to talk about representation because it would just be a normal thing collins added wienken says game changers has already had a huge impact on the amount of women playing and watching the game and there is more to come from the initiative with this year s launch of the game changers academy this new community driven format hopes to act as a stepping stone for young women who are interested in making it as a professional esports player by creating these new entry points for women wienken hopes that there won t be a need for female led projects such as the one she works with in the future i hope that we don t see gender anymore when we are looking at the professional players and we might not even need game changers anymore in the future because it s just so normal that esports is diverse she added for collins progress is all about how the media and wider society frame women in esports she s aware it will take time but is looking forward to the day when women in the industry aren t always asked to talk about their gender every single time a talent line up is being announced or every single time we talk about game changers i want the conversations to be about how the competition is amazing or this player has a great personality or just the crazy storylines the same way we talk about men s sport really she said i think if we can get to a point where women s esports and female talent aren t just being talked about because of their gender but they re actually being talked about because they re good at what they do i ll be pretty satisfied ',\n",
              " 'cnn in san quentin state prison and decades through a lengthy sentence rahsaan thomas wasn t at the peak of his physical fitness nor was he expecting that to change much sentenced to to life in after fatally shooting one person and injuring another during a drug deal thomas joined the prison s long distance running mile club initially as a coping mechanism that helped him to process his long and seemingly endless jail term that amount of time is mind blowing you think it s unfathomable but the way you deal with it is just one day at a time one step at a time he tells cnn sport in addition to keeping himself in shape thomas says that running which he first picked up aged to keep fit with his friends reminds me of home it s a way where i can just take my mind off the present and just focus on one step at a time he explains built by prisoners in the californian maximum security correctional facility which is among the usa s most well known and notorious for its violent history is not one you would immediately associate with fitness immortalized in documentaries movies songs and even graced with a performance by johnny cash the prison is the state s only such institution that conducts executions set up in san quentin s running club meets regularly and is run entirely by volunteer coaches from marin county s tamalpa running club who come from outside the facility to share their expertize and time with aspiring runners in the prison inmates start with conditioning and running shorter distances before potentially taking part in a full marathon negotiating laps of a gritty uneven prison track by the end of the year what started out as a makeshift club intended to support a small group of inmates who were interested in running miles each has now evolved into a group of more than members with participants ranging from those in their early s to late s a number of members have run several thousand miles in the prison seeing coaches come from the outside world and dedicate their time every week to train inside the maximum security prison gave thomas a sense of purpose which he carried with him even after his release thomas says that the club helps to rebuild connections within society you feel included in society even though you re excluded from it it s the magic ingredient to rehabilitation because you can do all kinds of programming through books and on a tablet it would never be the same as access to societies thomas aged at the time of his crime explains members of the club work towards a marathon over the course of a year to life when you re included in society and you re part of this world you re not going to hurt it because it s yours he adds now thomas story along with those of several other inmates is showcased in the film to life directed by christine yoo and premiering on espn on april coach diana fitzpatrick who volunteers at the prison agrees with thomas on the benefits of running explaining that it helps inmates to focus on working towards a goal as well as their diet and wellbeing i think for a lot of the men when they run it s a way to escape being inside of prison and where you are you sort of escape the walls you escape the noise you escape everything going on because you re really just focused she tells cnn sport adding that many men join the club with very little running experience it really brings you into the present the here and now especially when you re really pushing yourself like in a marathon fitzpatrick says coach jim maloney says the almost years long training regime helps men to remember that they are capable of doing hard things our incarceration system not only punishes people but it also has a tendency to dehumanize them says maloney i think one thing we try to do is help them gain their humanity back and remind themselves that they re not defined by the worst moment of their lives the crime that they committed but that they re worthy and worthwhile human beings adds maloney markelle taylor and coach kevin rumon to life the us locks up more people per capita than any other country according to the prison policy initiative which says that there are almost two million people incarcerated in federal state local and tribal systems in the us despite black americans making up only of the of the population they represent of the prison population according to the federal bureau of prisons black americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of white americans according to statistics from the sentencing project over two thirds of the prison population are people of color and socioeconomic disadvantage is common among this group until we understand what crime is we re never going to solve it for the most part it s poverty mixed with a lack of opportunity thomas tells cnn sport he points out that people commit crimes even if authorities have a tough on crime approaches because people their needs and their emotions are superseding intelligence no judgement markelle taylor was at a low point in his life when years into a lengthy sentence in san quentin state prison for second degree murder his close friend in the jail died by suicide it hurt me inside because he was more like a mentor to me taylor tells cnn sport to help cope with his grief taylor who had run track and field in high school joined the mile club the coaches passed no judgment never asked us what our crimes were that helped me in my recovery and transformation in my life taylor known as markelle the gazelle because of his athletic prowess explains he was sentenced at the age of for beating his pregnant girlfriend resulting in the premature birth of their child who died a month later from his injuries after years in prison and now in his s taylor is a runner and coach having been released on parole following a year of adjusting to life outside prison he began to train regularly again after completing the san quentin marathon in three hours and three minutes taylor was eligible to compete in the boston marathon which he finished in in after that first year it became a lot easier for me to get a good routine and running routine and run races and stuff like that that s why my times got faster as i got older taylor tells cnn there are all these different hurdles and obstacles that are overcome in my own personal life and i use those as the same as trying to pr personal record or strive to do better in all races running can help physical health mental health and rehabilitation volunteers at the prison say to life in having been incarcerated for years thomas had his sentence commuted with governor gavin newsom noting he had dedicated himself to his rehabilitation he completed the new york city marathon in now thomas works with juveniles and runs a program with some participants he explains that his past informs what he does with his newfound freedom saying i killed somebody that death is my driving force thomas also a journalist podcaster and producer says that while he knows he can t make up for it he is working all day long to make the world better and get the world to understand if you want to stop crime we got to address the root causes from those who have completed the program we have a zero recidivism rate he explains but there s two million people in prison thomas adds

              " 'following the release of last year s call of duty modern warfare publisher activision initially said that the annual military shooter franchise would take a year off this is what made the late summer announcement of a third game in the rebooted modern warfare spin off fairly strange with reports beginning to reveal that call of duty modern warfare was initially conceived as an expansion to its predecessor the disappointing end result makes sense potentially going down in franchise history as the worst cod since s call of duty ghosts everything from single player to multiplayer feels half baked and rushed despite being a fully priced game the lack of overall value in modern warfare even considering series low points is simply mind boggling if there s any indication that the mainline entries in call of duty need to take a break post microsoft acquisition this release should serve as the ultimate example developer sledgehammer games takes the reins of mw after s middling world war ii entry vanguard for this entry the single player wonkily divides the mission structure between more traditional linear moments the series is known for and open combat missions meanwhile multiplayer is a backstep that doesn t push the most important aspect of the series into new directions the fact that the launch lineup of maps is directly pulled from the og modern warfare in seems like a lazy cash grab call of duty modern warfare is available now on playstation xbox one series x s and pc here are our thoughts on the shooter after playing around a week and a half split between single player and multiplayer modes what we liked about it single player campaign takes some interesting chances outside of providing a narrative and showing off the series hollywood blockbuster like production values a cod single player campaign s main goal is to get players comfortable with gameplay mechanics for multiplayer considering how much has changed with the series with battle royale favorite warzone and dmz later on both modes were going to influence the single player campaign eventually this is where the introduction of open combat missions come into play these missions essentially take place in a large open map and allow players to take on objectives in any way they see fit players can attempt to be stealthy or run in guns blazing there are even weapon stashes conveniently placed around the maps which takes away from the level of realism developer infinity ward attempted to display in the first two modern warfare reboots however there is a small bit of entertainment value in attempting to play out missions differently the first mission features series protagonist farah karim attempting to secure american made missiles at a port from reimagined villain vladimir makarov these open combat portions make up nearly half the single player campaign but the more standard linear missions still stand out the most activision blizzard the opening mission in mw is definitely better than that of the last entry and serves as a grand introduction to makarov players initiate a raid on the zordaya prison complex situated in verdansk where players get a clever understanding of how evil the fictional russian warmonger is from the jump before things get even darker in a callback to the og modern warfare s controversial no russian mission there is one mission that does establish makarov as the most ruthless villain in franchise history other highlightable missions include a fairly dynamic mission in siberia alongside a flashback mission in verdansk stadium that takes place during a terrorist attack where serious precision is a must presentation is still top notch activision blizzard one thing that remains consistent with any mainline cod game is the phenomenal audio and visual presentation though it doesn t push any new visual boundaries mw stands next to its predecessor when it comes to graphics quality everything from texture detail animation and lighting to pre rendered cutscenes all look fantastic it doesn t matter if players are in linear or open combat the game manages to maintain a speedy and smooth frame rate without any noticeable dips like other games in the series it s extremely scalable on gaming pcs alongside different visual modes for both ps and xbox series x s regardless of how one plays mw players are in for a visual treat that performs well too what players hear is just as important as what they see when it comes to contemporary cod games and mw manages to deliver in spades as well guns sound incredibly powerful the soundtrack composed by walter mair following the departure of series reboot composer sarah schachner is as cinematic as ever all of the cast from the previous games returns including barry sloane as sas captain john price and samuel roukin stepping back in the shoes as lieutenant simon ghost riley it s also important to note that julian kostov brings a real gravitas to makarov as one of the most memorable villains loads of things to do in multiplayer considering how short the single player campaign is more on that later the multiplayer will make up a majority of your experience with mw thankfully there s tons to do when playing against or with various individuals online one thing that returning players will appreciate is that all progress from last year s mw gets carried over too as mentioned previously the first set of standard multiplayer maps at launch is directly pulled from the original mw which could be considered problematic for some it s been well over a decade so many of these maps may be new to series newcomers and they ve been visually updated it would be nice to have some fresh places for battle during more standard modes like team deathmatch search and destroy kill confirmed and hardpoint one new mode within the rotation of maps is called cutthroat the vv mode has three teams attempting to kill one another in sets of three rounds players can get placed into a knocked down state like in warzone and can potentially be revived by teammates activision blizzard there are some new maps that lend themselves to various usage of urzikstan from warzone including ground war and war like previous iterations ground war is a v mode that attempts to reach the scope of electronic art s battlefield games a more containable v mode called war features an interesting concept that has one team completing a linear section of objectives as the other team attempts to stop them the most interesting mode is zombies mode which comes to the modern warfare subseries for the first time the best way to describe this take on zombies is that it blends the open world objective gameplay of dmz with light inspirations from tom clancy s rainbow six extraction players land on a zombified version of urzikstan and complete objectives between objectives players can upgrade their player and guns like previous iterations of zombies activision blizzard modern warfare offers a compelling multiplayer experience especially with the inclusion of familiar maps and cutthroat mode while some may find the recycled maps from mw a bit nostalgic the addition of new maps that tie into warzone and the introduction of the zombies mode make mw a unique and engaging installment for both returning players and newcomers alike what we didn t like about it single player is incredibly short since the franchise began decades ago the average cod single player campaign usually lasts between and hours this is usually enough to get a respectable narrative while playing around with various combat scenarios on a casual playthrough mw can literally be finished within a night during our playthrough we clocked in around five hours before the final credits rolled the open combat missions add some replay value to missions but not enough to make them feel like completely different experiences like mw and unlike mw there isn t a collateral damage score for accidentally killing innocent people when those moments happen now mw does end on a cliffhanger so maybe some more single player campaign missions will be available down the line right now though the lack of real meat is noticeable considering the short development time that sledgehammer games had as well as reports that mw was originally going be an expansion pack the shorter single player is understandable the problem comes in charging for a handful of short missions enemy ai and open combat missions are problematic though call of duty as a series has continued to make progress when it comes to single player one thing that hasn t gotten better is the enemy ai when playing more linear missions that get players from point a to point b in the most cinematic way possible there are many ways for enemy combatants to rush and flank players the same is true for mw nothing changes in terms of ai dynamics during the more traditional moments it s literally the same even during more stealth missions activision blizzard even during stealth missions there s no real tension as ai isn t very smart one mission titled deep cover places players in the shoes of series regular kate laswell as she infiltrates arklov peak military base it ll remind many of the desperate measures mission from call of duty black ops cold war where players infiltrate the kgb but without the clever yet tense moments the worst flaws in the enemy ai become more pronounced during the open combat missions when attempting to be stealthy enemies barely react to their teams being killed in front of them outside of a short alarmed state and possible running to an alarm to bring in more combatants it s relatively easy to use the open world against them once engaged in a firefight they have to be dedicated because enemies always know a player s position it s impossible to play cool cat and mouse games like in far cry or the last of us whether navigating linear or stealth missions the persistent lack of adaptive enemy ai detracts from the overall experience as the series evolves addressing these shortcomings is paramount to unlocking the full potential of the immersive and challenging narratives that the call of duty franchise has the capacity to deliver it feels like an overpriced expansion activision blizzard the single player is remarkably short and the multiplayer is pretty much made up of mostly recycled assets why is this game fully priced considering this game was only in development for a year and a half and initially created as an expansion pack the lack of real consumer value with mw is borderline disrespectful even the quality of multiplayer has taken some hits this time due to spawn points that are bad enough for activision to pull maps from player rotation mw might have been a different recommendation if the price were significantly less but this year seems like a shameless cash grab it s obvious that there will be more maps characters guns and the like coming via seasonal updates that ll probably cost real world money this means that dedicated players are going to be paying more than for a game with less value than its predecessor bottom line call of duty modern warfare dissapoints with a short and lackluster single player campaign presenting a missed opportunity for innovation and narrative depth the recycled maps in multiplayer although nostalgic contribute to an overall sense of the game being an expensive expansion despite the top notch presentation and the addition of new modes like cutthroat the game thoroughly falls short when modern warfare was rebooted in it set the stage for something that many hoped would resurrect a slowly dying series though the rise of popular spinoff warzone has made the series as popular as ever the sacrifice is that mainline entries lack a real spirit ',\n",

hasn t changed but now years into their journey the band has conceived yet another new way to experience their music live four concerts at sphere the billion venue in las vegas that was christened last fall with a series of shows by u the phish shows kicked off thursday and run through sunday night it s a paradigm shift in live music and visual presentation trey anastasio phish s bandleader and

but while u played mostly the same set list and paired songs with pre made videos that repeated each night phish is taking their usual freewheeling approach the band is not repeating any songs over their four night run and each show s visuals are different and even improvised in the moment similar to what fans have become accustomed to from phish s long time lighting designer chris ck kuroda all of our visuals can be executed modified and manipulated in real time the band s creative director for the shows at sphere abigail rosen holmes told cnn they will follow the band s musical performance rather than being locked in allowing phish to play as freely as they would at any other show phish performing thursday at sphere i could see the audience so clearly bandleader trey anastasio said after alive coverage sure enough on thursday s opening night the psychedelic animations and graphics appeared to soar and glide to the music creating d effects on sphere s huge screen each song featured distinct visual eye candy from layered abstract tapestries to breathtaking scenic imagery both earthly and otherworldly daniel jean of moment factory the montreal based multimedia studio that produced and co directed the visuals told cnn that working on sphere s immersive s screen has opened the door to creativity in ways we haven t been able to explore before the emotions of the music mixed cohesively with the visuals on the screen create an emphatic moment only truly felt by those in the venue members of phish say they studied u s concert sphere residency to prepare for playing the venue phish s audio engineer even re created a miniature version of sphere s production setup at a practice studio in pennsylvania last summer so the band could fine tune the shows look and sound last week anastasio said it would be a challenge to use sphere s massive space in a way that still felt organic when you see a large scale production you know beyoncé or u or anything that s really a big major pop act the production and the music are on a click so it makes it easier to have everything happen at the proper time he said and we don t do that but after thursday night s show he sounded pleased with the venue saying he felt an intimacy at sphere despite its cavernous size i could see the audience so clearly which has such a huge effect on the music when i can look directly at people dancing i play so much better i can react to their energy i did not expect that he told cnn via email it s a huge blessing it felt very comfortable from the start phish cultivated a profound bond with its audience phish s signature sound centers around progressive rock arrangements infused with a variety of musical genres including jazz funk and blues and beyond the band formed in while its members were attending college in vermont where anastasio met drummer jon fishman and bassist mike gordon keyboardist page mcconnell joined the group about two years later we started out as a group of friends in a room with our friends anastasio said we would play until in the morning and then we would all go out to howard johnson s for eggs and french toast literally like the band and the audience and in some respects that never changed it still feels like that in their infancy the band started playing residencies at nectars then a burlington restaurant and bar with a small stage in the corner from the beginning they practiced their complex arrangements religiously often following anastasio s daily schedule detailing which times they would flesh out specific sections of each tune gradually phish built a fan base mostly through relentless touring across the us page mcconnell trey anastasio and jon fishman of phish left to right perform at bridgestone arena in nashville tennessee on october keith griner getty images for aba we built up this following just by playing gordon says in bittersweet motel director todd phillips documentary about the band it was never really records or radio or videos or anything like that that boosted our career it was all this word of mouth thing the fans come to shows because they don t know what s going to happen gordon added just like we don t know what s going to happen a sentiment that both band members and fans say hasn t changed we were never really in the public eye anastasio told cnn last week we don t have hits or go the grammys or anything like that it s a community is what it is and it really truly is and it still feels that way i think that s pretty much a big part of what makes us different anastasio says he can feel the energy from the crowd during each show and that informs his decisions on what the band plays in real time an approach phish has taken its entire existence it has a mind of its own everything s fair game anastasio said it s like a combination of discipline and complete abandon i don t think you can have one without the other the band s concerts have included covers of other groups classic albums and donuts anastasio says he enjoys spearheading the complicated logistics required to pull off their elaborate productions his focus is making sure his bandmates stay in the moment on stage if mike gordon is totally not thinking he plays the sickest bass of anybody who has ever lived he said as soon as you get him thinking he s not playing well anymore anastasio says his most exhilarating live moments are when the band goes completely off the map into uncharted musical territory phish took full advantage of the massive sphere led screen they built an incredible bond with fans by super serving their audience says siriusxm s ari fink alive coverage and there are many of them where i don t know where the downbeat is and i don t know what key we re in anymore and my head is exploding about what mike is playing or what fish is playing or what page is playing he said and it feels like being in a tiny tiny rowboat in the middle of a storm in the ocean the band has played more concerts at new york s fabled madison square garden than any act except billy joel on new year s eve in phish turned the arena into a giant undersea visual spectacle complete with flying dolphins a year later they created an almost fully realized broadway show at msg from their beloved gamehendge suite a fantasy rock opera last played in its entirety in people will ask us a normal band would build something like that and then take it on tour for four years why do you just do these things once anastasio said and my response would be that most of the people in the room have been seeing us for so long we feel like we owe them a new fresh experience the band also has become well known for staging elaborate events for halloween they sometimes adopt musical costumes and perform other artists classic albums a tradition they started in with a surprise cover of the beatles white album in its entirety on new year s eve they hosted the big cypress festival in the florida everglades where they played from midnight to sunrise before tens of thousands of fans to usher in the new millennium and in they famously played a string of themed shows over nights at madison square garden an event nicknamed the baker s dozen which included a different donut served to the audience each night in an era of tightly scripted concerts this playful unpredictable approach has endeared them to fans phish s trey anastasio we feel like we owe our fans a new fresh experience alive coverage every single show is different and they keep challenging themselves to be better said longtime phish fan andy bernstein who authored the first edition of the pharmer s almanac an encyclopedia that compiles the band s history and statistics they built an incredible bond with fans by super serving their audience said ari fink senior director of music programming at siriusxm radio where he worked with the band to create a phish radio channel fink says he understands the band s non traditional music may not be accessible to casual listeners i can totally understand the barrier of entry that some music fans might experience when they give phish a shot but the playfulness and the commitment to their craft are the two benchmarks they bring to the table he told cnn the band s members have been through a lot together after their sold out shows at sphere where top seats are commanding more than on the secondary market the quartet plans to go back on the road for another summer tour this july the same month they also plan to release evolve their th studio album the four members of phish have been playing together since the s when they were college students in vermont alive coverage in august phish are scheduled to host the mondegreen festival in delaware their th self produced large festival a tradition the band started in by taking over a decommissioned air force base in upstate new york no band endures for four decades without some turbulence and phish is no different anastasio battled drug and alcohol abuse before getting clean in the mid s the band took several hiatuses and its future once was unclear but the four musicians have persevered and they say their brotherhood has deepened over the years anastasio says his level of awe for his bandmates has grown consistently since they met as teenagers and they all feel immense gratitude that they still get to create magic together onstage the amount of material and the amount of shared history is just incomprehensible at this point in time i m trying to find some wood to knock on but it doesn t seem to be slowing down at all he said walking on stage has become consistently more emotional as the years have gone by like we look at each other before we go on he said i can t believe i have another chance to play with these guys wherever we are ',\n",
              " 'cnn the first thought hearing about the jinx part two was what could they possibly do for an encore reanimate the late robert durst and have him confess on a hot mic again after a few episodes though this nine years later continuation again proves quite compelling thanks not only to the late durst s idiosyncrasies but the star wars cantina of odd characters that surrounded him director andrew jarecki establishes that he sees this as an extension of what came before by numbering the six episodes as chapters seven through lest anyone have forgotten the original docuseries stunned audiences when durst after having been seemingly caught writing a damning note went to the bathroom and was recorded saying killed them all of course which many took as his confession regarding the disappearance of his wife kathie and subsequent murder of his friend susan berman while almost nothing could match that moment jarecki does what he can including footage of interesting parties watching a screening of the final episode of the jinx at his home in capturing their jaws agape responses he also has access to authorities interviewing durst and others as well as durst s jailhouse calls to friends most of whom appeared to be unsettlingly on board with trying to help him evade punishment nick chavin a durst pal who wound up testifying against him broadly sums up that mentality by saying in seemingly cavalier fashion that he lacks a moral hatred of murder and murderers similarly unearthed audio finds berman to have been more complicit than the filmmakers imagined in trying to help durst craft a plausible story regarding what might have happened to kathie los angeles deputy district attorney john lewin is featured in the jinx part two hbo for all that as new york time reporter charles bagli notes durst likely would have remained free and avoided prosecution if he had just kept his trap shut instead he chose to cooperate with jarecki for reasons that mystify authorities and durst confidants alike jarecki does an admirable job of getting key players to participate including deputy district attorney john lewin judge mark windham defense attorney dick deguerin and several jurors from the trial that resulted in durst s conviction for berman s murder he also incorporates amusing anecdotes such as durst s efforts to look especially frail to elicit sympathy perhaps a little too transparently given the abundance of juicy material the only shame is that jarecki felt obliged to dress the jinx part two up with the tricks of the trade including actor reenactments subtle but conspicuous of everything from durst looking down at kathie s body to staged aerial shots as he spoke with the authorities while these are by now common practices when so much is culled from reality blurring those lines feels unnecessary and even distracting along with netflix s making a murderer the jinx helped usher in a wave of true crime that at its best and most lurid has become every bit as valuable to premium networks and attention hungry streaming services as prestige dramas durst might be an unlikely hollywood leading man heck he couldn t even spell beverly hills properly but more than two years after his death he remains a source of fascination one that s as disturbing as it is alas hard to resist the jinx part two premieres april at p m et on hbo which like cnn is a unit of warner bros discovery ']"

We have to go through this, he has to go through that. He is one of the most experienced players we have in the squad. We will go through that but that\\u2019s pretty much all.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not that Mo [Salah] didn\\u2019t miss chances before in his life, that\\u2019s a part of the game. The penalty was super-convincing, a super penalty, then the next chance, that was obviously unlucky but it is not the first time he missed a chance like that.\\u201d\\n\\nJ\\u00fcrgen Klopp took Salah off in the second half of the match. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters\\n\\nAfter Klopp announced his decision to step down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season, many involved with the club had hoped to send off the 56-year-old German with another European trophy.\\n\\nFans had earmarked the Europa League final in Dublin, Ireland, as Klopp\\u2019s potential last game in charge, but those plans came crashing down on a frustrating night in Italy.\\n\\nKlopp insisted the game was not lost in the return leg, but in the disappointing 3-0 defeat at Anfield last week.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very easy to congratulate Atalanta because they deserved to go through. When you win a tie against us 3-1, especially in this way, you deserve to go through, absolutely,\\u201d added Klopp after his last Euorpean game in charge of Liverpool.\\n\\nElsewhere on Thursday, fellow Premier League side West Ham crashed out of the Europa League quarterfinals after losing 3-1 on aggregate to Bayer Leverkusen.\\n\\nIt followed the defeats suffered by Arsenal and Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, meaning there will be no English team in the semifinals of either competition for the first time since the 2014/15 season, per Opta.\\n\\nEnglish Premier League title race\\n\\nWith such disappointment in Europe for English clubs, all attention now turns back to the Premier League title race.\\n\\nAfter Liverpool and Arsenal suffered shock defeats on Sunday, reigning champion Manchester City moved top of the table and look favorites to go on to win the title.\\n\\nBut with both Arsenal and Liverpool just two points behind, there is all to play for with just six games remaining.\\n\\nKlopp, hoping to leave Liverpool with the perfect present of a league title, said his side can now fully focus on the remainder of the campaign. It faces Fulham in its next league game on Sunday.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have a few days to recover, we will do that, and then will travel the day after tomorrow to London and will play Fulham, which will be tricky but we will give our absolute all. That\\u2019s our competition now,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"Illuminated trademark of the American athletic footwear and apparel corporation Nike, Inc. seen on the Nike Store window in Antwerp, Belgium. (Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nNike CEO John Donahoe acknowledged Friday that the company moved too far away from wholesale partners like Macy's and DSW in its quest to become a retailer that primarily sells merchandise to shoppers through its own stores and website.\\n\\n\\\"We recognize that in our movement toward digital, we had over-rotated away from wholesale a little more than we intended,\\\" Donahoe told CNBC's Sara Eisen from Paris. \\\"We've corrected that. We're investing heavily with our retail partners. They were all here over the last couple of days; they're very excited about the innovation pipeline.\\\"\\n\\nOver the past several years, Nike has worked to transform its business from a brand that primarily sold its sneakers and clothes in department stores and specialty athletic shops to one that does the bulk of its sales direct to consumers.\\n\\nThe strategy allowed Nike to earn far more from its sales and gain better insights about its customers through data collection. Over the last four years, Donahoe said Nike tripled its mobile and digital business from about 10% of overall sales to 30%.\\n\\nHowever, it's a tough strategy to pull off and one that can pressure margins in the short term. Shifting to a direct model is capital-intensive and saddled Nike with the headaches of returns and owned inventory, which had typically fallen on wholesale partners.\\n\\nOn top of that, department stores and specialty shops are massive customer acquisition engines. Without them, brands have to spend more on marketing, which has become more expensive and challenging to do online.\",\n          \"Washington CNN \\u2014\\n\\nOn Tuesday, late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel delivered another monologue making fun of former President Donald Trump. On Wednesday morning, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee fired back on social media \\u2014 in part by attacking Kimmel for something Kimmel didn\\u2019t do.\\n\\nTrump, calling Kimmel \\u201cstupid,\\u201d blasted the comedian for his general performance as host of the Academy Awards in March and specifically for having read aloud, from the stage, Trump\\u2019s mid-show social media post criticizing how he was doing.

j\\u00fcrgen klopp said he was disappointed to see his side knocked out of the europa league quarterfinals against atalanta on thursday but insisted talisman mohamed salah was not to blame liverpool couldn t overcome the deficit from the first leg winning in italy but losing on aggregate salah had converted a penalty in the seventh minute to give his side hope of an unlikely comeback but the english premier league side failed to make the most of its dominance in large portions of the game salah himself missed a glorious chance to put his side up in the first half getting his lobbed finish all wrong after catching atalanta goalkeeper juan musso off his line it s the latest in a long run of missed chances with the egyptian failing to rediscover his clinical form after sustaining a muscle injury at the africa cup of nations in january had he scored it which he probably should have liverpool would have piled pressure on atalanta which was forced to defend resolutely for much of the first half i am not particularly concerned klopp told reporters when asked about salah s recent form that s what strikers do that s what happens to strikers that s how it is we have to go through this he has to go through that he is one of the most experienced players we have in the squad we will go through that but that s pretty much all it s not that mo salah didn t miss chances before in his life that s a part of the game the penalty was super convincing a super penalty then the next chance that was obviously unlucky but it is not the first time he missed a chance like that j\\u00fcrgen klopp took salah off in the second half of the match guglielmo mangiapane reuters after klopp announced his decision to step down as liverpool manager at the end of the season many involved with the club had hoped to send off the year old german with another european trophy fans had earmarked the europa league final in dublin ireland as klopp s potential last game in charge but those plans came crashing down on a frustrating night in italy klopp insisted the game was not lost in the return leg but in the disappointing defeat at anfield last week it s very easy to congratulate atalanta because they deserved to go through when you win a tie against us especially in this way you deserve to go through absolutely added klopp after his last euorpean game in charge of liverpool elsewhere on thursday fellow premier league side west ham crashed out of the europa league quarterfinals after losing on aggregate to bayer leverkusen it followed the defeats suffered by arsenal and manchester city in the champions league on wednesday meaning there will be no english team in the semifinals of either competition for the first time since the season per opta english premier league title race with such disappointment in europe for english clubs all attention now turns back to the premier league title race after liverpool and arsenal suffered shock defeats on sunday reigning champion manchester city moved top of the table and look favorites to go on to win the title but with both arsenal and liverpool just two points behind there is all to play for with just six games remaining klopp hoping to leave liverpool with the perfect present of a league title said his side can now fully focus on the remainder of the campaign it faces fulham in its next league game on sunday we have a few days to recover we will do that and then will travel the day after tomorrow to london and will play fulham which will be tricky but we will give our absolute all that s our competition now he

sells merchandise to shoppers through its own stores and website we recognize that in our movement toward digital we had over rotated away from wholesale a little more than we intended donahoe told cnbc s sara eisen from paris we ve corrected that we re investing heavily with our retail partners they were all here over the last couple of days they re very excited about the innovation pipeline over the past several years nike has worked to transform its business from a brand that primarily sold its sneakers and clothes in department stores and specialty athletic shops to one that does the bulk of its sales direct to consumers the strategy allowed nike to earn far more from its sales and gain better insights about its customers through data collection over the last four years donahoe said nike tripled its mobile and digital business from about of overall sales to however it s a tough strategy to pull off and one that can pressure margins in the short term shifting to a direct model is capital intensive and saddled nike with the headaches of returns and owned inventory which had typically fallen on wholesale partners on top of that department stores and specialty shops are

Incredibly, the nearly 10-year-old game has jumped all the way to the top of the GSD charts, which tracks digital games across all of Europe and physical sales in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. It now sits atop the weekly top ten, beating out Helldivers 2, EA Sports FC 24, and Grand Theft Auto 5.\\n\\nYou can probably guess why Fallout 4's sales have spiked to the extent that they have. First, it is seeing extremely deep discounts, with prices slashed by roughly 75 percent in some places. More importantly, the Fallout TV Series on Prime Video was released last week and has been met with praise from both critics and fans alike.\\n\\nFans are officially returning to Fallout 4's wasteland.\\n\\nBeyond the discounts and popularity of the Fallout TV series, Bethesda Softworks announced last week that the long-awaited next-gen update for Fallout 4 will be released on April 25 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. A gigantic mod, Fallout London, is in development; it was supposed to launch on April 23, but the creators had to delay the release, fearing that the next-gen update for Fallout 4 might break it.\\n\\n\\\"An outstanding world, great crafting system, strong story and characters, and more earn Fallout 4 a glowing endorsement,\\\" my colleague Dan Stapleton wrote in his review of Fallout 4 .\\n\\nYet, Fallout 4 is one of many games in the series that see an increase in the number of players following the success of the TV show. Earlier this week, Steam data tracker SteamDB reported that multiple Fallout games, including New Vegas and Fallout 76, had seen a significant boost in players on Valve's digital distribution platform, with Fallout 76, in particular, obtaining a new peak concurrent players Steam record of 39,455.\\n\\nLoading Play\\n\\nWith the Fallout TV series's success, it is no surprise to anyone that yesterday, Prime Video announced that the series was renewed for a second season.

And the committee ended this month with an additional $886,000 in outstanding legal bills \\u2013 most of which were owed to Robert & Robert, the firm that has represented Trump and his family in a business fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That case ended in February with a staggering $355 million judgment against him, not counting interest.\\n\\nOpening arguments are slated to begin Monday in a separate case, the criminal hush money trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has brought against Trump \\u2013 the first former president to face criminal prosecution. Save America paid a combined $1.14 million in March to Blanche Law and NechelesLaw LLP, whose principals have flanked Trump in court during jury selection in recent days.\\n\\nSaturday\\u2019s filings underscore how much financial ground Trump must make up as the general election campaign heats up. President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee expanded their cash advantage over Trump and the GOP in March.\\n\\nBiden\\u2019s principal campaign committee entered April with $85.5 million stockpiled in its war chest, while Trump\\u2019s main campaign account had $45.1 million.\\n\\nThe money Save America spent just on legal expenses last month rivals the $3.7 million Trump\\u2019s campaign committee spent altogether in March as he pursues a third bid for the White House. That marked a significantly slower pace of campaign spending for the former president.\\n\\nBy contrast, Biden\\u2019s campaign \\u2013 flush with money \\u2013 reported more than $29 million in expenditures last month. It plowed nearly $22 million into producing and placing campaign ads.\\n\\nDwindling resource\\n\\nSave America has relied on tens of millions of dollars it has clawed back from a Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. The new filings show the super PAC sent another $5 million back to Save America in March \\u2013 bringing its total refunds to $57.25 million.\\n\\nBut this source of money will soon run dry. The leadership PAC had donated a total of $60 million to MAGA Inc., and cannot seek more than that in refunds.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s political team will tap another cash pipeline in the quest to replenish that dwindling resource. Under a recently inked joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and dozens of state parties, Save America is slated to get a $5,000 slice of money collected from each individual donor who participates in high-dollar fundraising. And the agreement prioritizes payments to Save America ahead of contributions to the RNC, according to the fine print of an invitation obtained by CNN.\\n\\nThe first big event under the umbrella of the new fundraising committee \\u2013 a dinner at the Florida home of a billionaire investor \\u2013 raised a record $50.5 million, according to the Trump campaign.\\n\\nFinancial boost for Kennedy\\n\\nThis week\\u2019s filings also pointed to the financial boon that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\\u2019s vice presidential pick represents for his independent bid for the White House. His campaign received a $2 million contribution from Nicole Shanahan in March and raised more than $3 million more that month, campaign filings show.\\n\\nKennedy also burned through cash in March, spending $4.5 million, as the campaign spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consulting, events, advertising and payroll, up from February, when the campaign spent about $2.9 million. Kennedy\\u2019s campaign ended March with about $6 million in cash on hand.\\n\\nShanahan is an independently wealthy tech executive and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Politicians can contribute unlimited amounts of their own money to benefit their campaigns.\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.\",\n          \"CNN \\u2014\\n\\nThe Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \\u201cmassive fraud\\u201d in the 2020 election.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\\u201d the RNC call said. \\u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\\u2019t even an American citizen.\\u201d\\n\\nThe claim of \\u201cmassive fraud\\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office.\\n\\nBut the call\\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7.\\n\\nIt comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed. Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail.\\n\\nBut in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year.\\n\\nPolling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\\u2019s \\u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \\u201cin the past,\\u201d she didn\\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I think we\\u2019re past that. I think that\\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \\u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election.\\n\\nIn the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \\u201ctrust mail-in voting.\\u201d\\n\\nNeither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\nLara Trump speaks at the Republican National Committee spring meeting on March 8, in Houston. Cecile Clocheret/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nA long history of spreading election lies\\n\\nAs recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \\u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d\\n\\nOn her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election.\\n\\nOn an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \\u201csmell test\\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win.\\n\\n\\u201cNow, I don\\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThe comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\\u201d said one co-host.\\n\\n\\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s right. That\\u2019s true,\\u201d she responded.\\n\\nA CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results.\\n\\nThe 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting.\\n\\nLater in the episode, Trump said, \\u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\\u201d\\n\\nIn an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \\u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis.\\n\\nThough Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research.\\n\\nThough nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously.\\n\\n\\u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \\u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\\u2019re like, \\u2018oh my God, we can\\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this.

Incredibly, the nearly 10-year-old game has jumped all the way to the top of the GSD charts, which tracks digital games across all of Europe and physical sales in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. It now sits atop the weekly top ten, beating out Helldivers 2, EA Sports FC 24, and Grand Theft Auto 5.\\n\\nYou can probably guess why Fallout 4's sales have spiked to the extent that they have. First, it is seeing extremely deep discounts, with prices slashed by roughly 75 percent in some places. More importantly, the Fallout TV Series on Prime Video was released last week and has been met with praise from both critics and fans alike.\\n\\nFans are officially returning to Fallout 4's wasteland.\\n\\nBeyond the discounts and popularity of the Fallout TV series, Bethesda Softworks announced last week that the long-awaited next-gen update for Fallout 4 will be released on April 25 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. A gigantic mod, Fallout London, is in development; it was supposed to launch on April 23, but the creators had to delay the release, fearing that the next-gen update for Fallout 4 might break it.\\n\\n\\\"An outstanding world, great crafting system, strong story and characters, and more earn Fallout 4 a glowing endorsement,\\\" my colleague Dan Stapleton wrote in his review of Fallout 4 .\\n\\nYet, Fallout 4 is one of many games in the series that see an increase in the number of players following the success of the TV show. Earlier this week, Steam data tracker SteamDB reported that multiple Fallout games, including New Vegas and Fallout 76, had seen a significant boost in players on Valve's digital distribution platform, with Fallout 76, in particular, obtaining a new peak concurrent players Steam record of 39,455.\\n\\nLoading Play\\n\\nWith the Fallout TV series's success, it is no surprise to anyone that yesterday, Prime Video announced that the series was renewed for a second season.

And the committee ended this month with an additional $886,000 in outstanding legal bills \\u2013 most of which were owed to Robert & Robert, the firm that has represented Trump and his family in a business fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That case ended in February with a staggering $355 million judgment against him, not counting interest.\\n\\nOpening arguments are slated to begin Monday in a separate case, the criminal hush money trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has brought against Trump \\u2013 the first former president to face criminal prosecution. Save America paid a combined $1.14 million in March to Blanche Law and NechelesLaw LLP, whose principals have flanked Trump in court during jury selection in recent days.\\n\\nSaturday\\u2019s filings underscore how much financial ground Trump must make up as the general election campaign heats up. President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee expanded their cash advantage over Trump and the GOP in March.\\n\\nBiden\\u2019s principal campaign committee entered April with $85.5 million stockpiled in its war chest, while Trump\\u2019s main campaign account had $45.1 million.\\n\\nThe money Save America spent just on legal expenses last month rivals the $3.7 million Trump\\u2019s campaign committee spent altogether in March as he pursues a third bid for the White House. That marked a significantly slower pace of campaign spending for the former president.\\n\\nBy contrast, Biden\\u2019s campaign \\u2013 flush with money \\u2013 reported more than $29 million in expenditures last month. It plowed nearly $22 million into producing and placing campaign ads.\\n\\nDwindling resource\\n\\nSave America has relied on tens of millions of dollars it has clawed back from a Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. The new filings show the super PAC sent another $5 million back to Save America in March \\u2013 bringing its total refunds to $57.25 million.\\n\\nBut this source of money will soon run dry. The leadership PAC had donated a total of $60 million to MAGA Inc., and cannot seek more than that in refunds.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s political team will tap another cash pipeline in the quest to replenish that dwindling resource. Under a recently inked joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and dozens of state parties, Save America is slated to get a $5,000 slice of money collected from each individual donor who participates in high-dollar fundraising. And the agreement prioritizes payments to Save America ahead of contributions to the RNC, according to the fine print of an invitation obtained by CNN.\\n\\nThe first big event under the umbrella of the new fundraising committee \\u2013 a dinner at the Florida home of a billionaire investor \\u2013 raised a record $50.5 million, according to the Trump campaign.\\n\\nFinancial boost for Kennedy\\n\\nThis week\\u2019s filings also pointed to the financial boon that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\\u2019s vice presidential pick represents for his independent bid for the White House. His campaign received a $2 million contribution from Nicole Shanahan in March and raised more than $3 million more that month, campaign filings show.\\n\\nKennedy also burned through cash in March, spending $4.5 million, as the campaign spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consulting, events, advertising and payroll, up from February, when the campaign spent about $2.9 million. Kennedy\\u2019s campaign ended March with about $6 million in cash on hand.\\n\\nShanahan is an independently wealthy tech executive and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Politicians can contribute unlimited amounts of their own money to benefit their campaigns.\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.\",\n          \"CNN \\u2014\\n\\nThe Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \\u201cmassive fraud\\u201d in the 2020 election.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\\u201d the RNC call said. \\u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\\u2019t even an American citizen.\\u201d\\n\\nThe claim of \\u201cmassive fraud\\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office.\\n\\nBut the call\\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7.\\n\\nIt comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed. Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail.\\n\\nBut in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year.\\n\\nPolling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\\u2019s \\u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \\u201cin the past,\\u201d she didn\\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I think we\\u2019re past that. I think that\\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \\u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election.\\n\\nIn the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \\u201ctrust mail-in voting.\\u201d\\n\\nNeither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\nLara Trump speaks at the Republican National Committee spring meeting on March 8, in Houston. Cecile Clocheret/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nA long history of spreading election lies\\n\\nAs recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \\u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \\u201cNo, we don\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d\\n\\nOn her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election.\\n\\nOn an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \\u201csmell test\\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win.\\n\\n\\u201cNow, I don\\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThe comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\\u201d said one co-host.\\n\\n\\u201cOh yeah, that\\u2019s right. That\\u2019s true,\\u201d she responded.\\n\\nA CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results.\\n\\nThe 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting.\\n\\nLater in the episode, Trump said, \\u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\\u201d\\n\\nIn an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \\u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis.\\n\\nThough Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research.\\n\\nThough nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously.\\n\\n\\u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \\u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\\u2019re like, \\u2018oh my God, we can\\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this.
